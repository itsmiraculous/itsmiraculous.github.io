WEBVTT

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.100
It was the day of the last enchanted eclipse

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:26.572
Wu shifu was desperate

00:00:26.702 --> 00:00:29.075
The secret he watched over was in danger

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.645
We are shameful Master, we are not worthy of your teaching

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.415
Don't go! I still have so much to teach you

00:00:35.553 --> 00:00:37.358
What happened to ancestral values?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100
Courage, loyalty, honesty

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.100
A stranger did everything for that the teacher was forced to sell his school

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:51.053
Someone wanted to take over the land on which it was built and nothing seemed to be able to stop him

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.770
The school was everything for Wu Shifu. His students were like his childs.

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:03.007
And without children, he had no one to give his heritage to, and all the responsibilities that they accompanied

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:12.179
To whom was he going to be able to confide his heavy secret? And what If there was no one left to watch over the cave during the next enchanted eclipse?

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:15.917
From now on, alone, he had no more hope

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:19.569
And that's when we met

00:01:22.943 --> 00:01:26.943
He chose my name. In Mandarin, it means «Flying in the air»

00:01:31.451 --> 00:01:33.451
I am Fei.

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:37.728
After becoming my adoptive father, Wu Shifu taught me the values of Kung Fu

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100
And made me the new guardian

00:01:42.747 --> 00:01:44.747
But they always hunted us down

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.100
They ended up taking my adoptive father

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.197
And even by stealing the bracelet

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.419
and destroying the school

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:12.865
From now on, there was only me to protect the secret of the cave during the next enchanted eclipse

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.100
That's it!
It's finally the holidays and they are off to an exceptional start

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:04.700
We'd go to the pool, to the movies, to the museum,

00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:09.192
Take long walks. We even had a big picnic where everyone would be there.

00:03:09.217 --> 00:03:13.372
Even Adrien would be there, his Father give us his consent

00:03:13.787 --> 00:03:14.787
Yes, the holidays started well

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.100
Even for Cat Noir and I

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.100
We had a few missions, but no Akumatized in sight

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.100
Hawk moth seemed to have taken holidays too

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.100
We started to relax a bit, because who knows what "holidays" means for hawk moth

00:03:30.488 --> 00:03:32.634
Anyway, we thought everything was fine

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.973
Until everything starts to go wrong

00:03:36.593 --> 00:03:43.610
Sorry Marinette, but I can't leave the bakery today and if you don't go now he won't receive the gift in time for his birthday!

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.100
Okay I'll go

00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:47.985
Thank you, Sweetie

00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:00.360
I'm sorry, but I have a little setback

00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:03.694
I don't why, but it don't surprises me at all

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.275
Save me a place next to "you know who" please!

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.437
I'm rushing to join you

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.394
But, you don't know? I thought you knew

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.509
What? What am I supposed to know?

00:04:11.534 --> 00:04:13.534
Adrien left for Shanghai

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:14.559
Huh??!

00:04:14.584 --> 00:04:17.584
It's probably a mistake!! I always know what to know about Adrien

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.175
His 5 first names and the dates that match them!

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.200
His schedule of the year and even his size..

00:04:22.244 --> 00:04:25.248
If there was anything to know about him, I would be aware!

00:04:25.273 --> 00:04:26.843
But.. he was also unaware of it..

00:04:26.868 --> 00:04:31.445
He told Nino that the inauguration of his father's store in Shanghai was decided last minute.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.603
*gasps*

00:04:35.365 --> 00:04:36.365
Shanghai...

00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:45.145
You're a dolphin. You jump from waves to waves in an ocean of sweetness.

00:04:46.088 --> 00:04:53.312
The opening of this store is essential for the future of the Agreste Family, Adrien. The fact that it's earlier than planned is  a good new.

00:04:53.337 --> 00:04:56.305
There will be other picnics with your friends

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.330
Probably

00:04:57.355 --> 00:05:00.133
Besides, I'm happy to spend time with you, father

00:05:00.158 --> 00:05:02.158
Yes, I am also pleased

00:05:02.183 --> 00:05:05.589
But before that, I still have to work out organizational details

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:14.339
Did you have time to check everything out,  Nathalie?

00:05:14.364 --> 00:05:18.364
All the necessary conditions at the enchanted eclipse will be well met tomorrow, sir.

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.355
I beg you master.. Think about it..

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.066
The Prodigious hasn't been abandoned in a cave for nothing.
It's in favor of the miraculouses..

00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:38.855
It was locked up because it is far too powerful, too dangerous!

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.309
Precisely, Nooroo. The miraculouses of Ladybug and Cat Noir have been defeating me for far too long..

00:05:44.334 --> 00:05:48.550
I can't miss an opportunity to defeat them with higher powers

00:05:48.575 --> 00:05:52.065
What I started for now 15 years ago, I intend to finish it tomorrow.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.543
Finally..

00:05:54.885 --> 00:05:55.885
Mom!!

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:58.756
B-But the package.. He will never get it in time!!

00:05:59.043 --> 00:06:02.043
Of course it is mom because I decided  to go and bring the package myself!

00:06:02.443 --> 00:06:07.079
Umm.. Yeah because it's time to visit my uncle in person

00:06:07.224 --> 00:06:08.543
Because my uncle-

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:09.568
*falls*

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:11.029
It's my origins!

00:06:11.054 --> 00:06:13.016
And I'm trying to connect with Adrie-

00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:16.116
I mean, with my origins... It's been a long time... They don't stop.

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:19.007
I mean *they* - my origins, won't stop escaping me!

00:06:19.032 --> 00:06:21.565
And without him, err- finally without them, my origins...

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.304
I mean... I feel incomplete!

00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:27.329
Marinette, Are you telling us that you want to go to Shanghai?!

00:06:31.637 --> 00:06:35.241
You know, your mother and I have been waiting for this moment for a long time

00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:40.266
We always hope you'd want to go to Shanghai to see the country of your ancestors, and connect with your Chinese family

00:06:40.495 --> 00:06:47.495
We've been putting money aside since the day  you were born what to organize  a family trip. We've been waiting for you to ask us.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.520
That you'd be ready

00:06:49.157 --> 00:06:50.812
But right now..It's sudden

00:06:51.156 --> 00:06:53.597
Yes, but we can't close the bakery like this..

00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:56.353
If you want to bring the gift to Uncle Wang

00:06:56.378 --> 00:06:57.907
You will have to go on the journey alone...

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:01.642
You are the best parents in the universe!

00:07:12.873 --> 00:07:14.426
What a pleasure to see you

00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:17.317
I’m very happy that you finally come.

00:07:17.342 --> 00:07:18.798
I’m happy too!

00:07:18.823 --> 00:07:20.595
And like that you gonna have your present at the time!

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.985
You know my most beautiful present is your visit Marinette.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.657
Your mother tell me you would like to connect you
at your roots and that makes me very happy.

00:07:27.682 --> 00:07:32.023
I have a lot of reservations at my restaurant this weekend but I cancelled everything, thanks to you...

00:07:32.048 --> 00:07:35.445
I am on holiday for the first time since-

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.648
since your mother was leave to France.

00:07:37.673 --> 00:07:39.523
You did all that for me?

00:07:39.548 --> 00:07:42.926
Of course yes! Family is sacred!

00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:45.975
You have made good progress in French since your last visit..

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.438
I have worked hardest for communicated with you!

00:07:49.463 --> 00:07:56.214
I can tell you all the stories of our ancestors and then we can visit Shanghai

00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:59.174
and you can learn all the traditional songs of the Cheng!

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:01.648
The Cheng have a traditional songs?

00:08:03.912 --> 00:08:06.027
Bund's district is impressive, Father.

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:08.653
Have you ever visited Shanghai during one of your trips?

00:08:08.678 --> 00:08:10.075
Yes, obviously

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.634
You could maybe show me around the city, it'd be amazing to see this together

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:18.738
Yes, undoubtedly. But before anything else, there are some things I need to take care of for tomorrow's inauguration

00:08:19.705 --> 00:08:22.346
I guess the only thing I have to do is to stay at the hotel whilst waiting for you...

00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:27.272
On the contrary, enjoy this beautiful day to go out and take a walk around. I'll join you in the afternoon

00:08:32.106 --> 00:08:37.031
Your great great grandfather would draw clothes for Pekin's opera artists!

00:08:37.793 --> 00:08:39.793
Marinette! Marinette! Marinette!

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.793
Yes Bastille, I'm really proud to finally be able to introduce you to Marinette

00:08:45.568 --> 00:08:47.568
Delighted to meet you uh.. Bastille

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.862
Bastille has been in the family since forever, look

00:08:50.887 --> 00:08:53.237
He was already there for your Grandpa Yen ,

00:08:53.262 --> 00:08:56.075
Grandma Chun's era, and your mom Xia Ping

00:08:56.528 --> 00:08:57.528
Xia Ping?

00:08:57.621 --> 00:09:01.326
Yes, she only named herself Sabine when she started living in France

00:09:01.924 --> 00:09:02.924
Woah...

00:09:03.777 --> 00:09:05.633
I had never seen this picture of mom before

00:09:06.256 --> 00:09:08.791
Magical ingredient! Magical ingredient!

00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:11.004
Don't worry, I didn't forget

00:09:11.029 --> 00:09:13.113
Do you remember my way of cooking?

00:09:13.569 --> 00:09:18.476
Eh? Uh- Oh! Of course! Haha! You always improvise with something that destiny sends in your way

00:09:18.501 --> 00:09:20.487
And today, it's you that destiny sent to me

00:09:20.512 --> 00:09:22.976
But I didn't bring any ingredients along with me

00:09:27.546 --> 00:09:29.164
Oh... This gives me an idea...

00:09:29.189 --> 00:09:31.402
I can go out talk a walk to see if destiny puts Adri-

00:09:31.427 --> 00:09:34.075
Uuh I mean, a magical ingredient on my way!

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.926
Aren't you scared of getting lost? You can't speak Chinese at all

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.075
I can't get lost as long as I've got my phone! There's an instant GPS and traductor!

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.508
Alright, but don't get too far, you'll find everything you need in the neighborhood

00:09:46.774 --> 00:09:50.095
And I'm sure that tonight's meal will be magical!

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:56.959
Do you plan on putting Adrien in a soup?

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:03.075
Of course not, Tikki! We're going to search for a magical ingredient, and we'll benefit from this walk to go and say hi to Adrien!

00:10:03.763 --> 00:10:04.763
You mean "Ni hao"?

00:10:05.979 --> 00:10:06.979
You can speak mandarin?

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.551
Well, yes! Kwamis can speak every language!

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:13.075
It makes sense now that you say it, you can't know who'll be your next wielder

00:10:13.235 --> 00:10:14.942
How are you going to manage finding Adrien?

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.647
Look, it's simple. We are here, and him, he's right there

00:10:18.982 --> 00:10:22.006
We just need to follow the map, it's gonna be a piece of cake!

00:10:24.865 --> 00:10:26.865
Look guys!
Hey, aren't you Adrien Agreste, the famous model?

00:10:31.075 --> 00:10:33.075
Please let them, it doesn't bother me

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.427
[he may know how to speak chinese- but i don't]

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:40.268
I'm there Nathalie, now I just need to find the perfect target to akumatize

00:11:43.516 --> 00:11:46.516
Oh dear... It didn't seem so far on the map...

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.620
I'd like to see people for who they are

00:11:55.646 --> 00:11:59.646
Think of them as stories, their little joys, their great happiness

00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:00.917
Their deceptions, their achievements

00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:05.141
This is how my father would've wanted me to perceive them

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:29.829
In order to be the guardian he wanted me to be, I have to forget who I truly am

00:12:29.854 --> 00:12:32.038
I absolutely have to retrieve the key

00:12:32.063 --> 00:12:34.063
And to do so, I need money

00:12:34.088 --> 00:12:37.734
Someone is able to let me know the truth
about what happened to my adoptive father...

00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:39.036
but I have to pay him!

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:01.621
Father! Are you done?

00:13:02.075 --> 00:13:05.075
Ah... Yes, I understand...

00:13:06.075 --> 00:13:09.075
Later? Yes, of course, if you'd like...

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.100
See you later, father

00:13:12.308 --> 00:13:14.479
One thing is sure, your father will never change!

00:13:14.504 --> 00:13:18.516
A quality that we can appreciate when it comes to soft cheese, but for a human?

00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:22.005
Pouah! What wouldn't I do for a good meal!

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.674
I have what you need Plagg, do you remember Wang Shifu, Marinette's uncle?

00:13:27.699 --> 00:13:30.212
His restaurant of a thousand delicacies is located in Shanghai

00:13:30.395 --> 00:13:31.437
Yess

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.580
There's a place I'd like to go to, do you agree?

00:13:45.881 --> 00:13:46.881
Sorry

00:13:56.814 --> 00:13:59.100
Adrien! Adrien!

00:14:01.092 --> 00:14:02.405
Adrien!

00:14:06.864 --> 00:14:09.864
Oh no! Look!

00:14:13.499 --> 00:14:15.999
Oh no! Poor girl. I'll help her.

00:14:28.055 --> 00:14:30.055
Tikki, spots on!

00:14:30.881 --> 00:14:31.881
Tikki?!

00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:35.529
Tikki!

00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:46.628
TIKKIIIIII!!!

00:15:09.444 --> 00:15:13.100
Marinette is in Shanghai? That's an incredible coincidence

00:15:13.681 --> 00:15:14.631
That's the destiny

00:15:14.656 --> 00:15:16.728
Love is beautiful!

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.501
Haha! No, Marinette is just a friend

00:15:20.517 --> 00:15:22.016
What if we make a surprise for her?

00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:23.670
Would you like me to wait for her with you?

00:15:23.695 --> 00:15:27.695
Of course! She should come soon, you can help me to make the food if you want to

00:15:28.272 --> 00:15:31.944
*speaks Chinese*

00:15:35.747 --> 00:15:39.747
I've lost my Miraculous, my kwagamata, and Tikki

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:47.921
Without my phone to find my way, or translate what i'm saying, there wasn't any way I could go back to my uncle Wang's house, or get help...

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.100
Bastille, go find some pepper in the reserve please!

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.060
Pepper! Pepper! Coming right up!

00:16:20.748 --> 00:16:24.403
I'm looking for these earrings, have you seen anyone wearing them?

00:16:25.223 --> 00:16:26.174
I don't understand...

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.306
Oh!

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:28.948
Here...

00:16:30.208 --> 00:16:31.790
Is this what you need?

00:16:36.567 --> 00:16:38.567
Is Marinette usually late?

00:16:38.592 --> 00:16:43.100
Marinette? She's always late, it would be surprising if she came right on time

00:16:44.285 --> 00:16:46.285
Hm… i'll still call her

00:16:58.602 --> 00:17:00.224
It's Marinette! Leave a message, beep

00:17:00.745 --> 00:17:07.061
Err- Marinette, It's Uncle Wang, I hope you didn't get lost, I'm waiting you with…

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.649
A surprise!

00:17:08.767 --> 00:17:09.287
See you!

00:17:33.225 --> 00:17:38.854
Oh! They're really pretty, Thanks miss, it's not what I'm looking for but it's really nice of you for wanting to help me

00:17:38.879 --> 00:17:40.379
*insists she keeps it*

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.213
Thanks a lot.

00:17:47.812 --> 00:17:51.327
I went there everyday to sell what I managed to retrieve.

00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:55.096
Day after day, I paid the one who was supposed to help me get revenge.

00:17:55.121 --> 00:17:55.734
Cash!

00:17:57.539 --> 00:18:01.062
Fei, what treasures are you bringing me today?

00:18:05.834 --> 00:18:07.834
You’re going to tell me again that there isn’t anything valuable in there ?

00:18:08.561 --> 00:18:15.561
I’m doing everything I can to help you, really, but everything has a price and the price of those things is not particularly high.

00:18:15.885 --> 00:18:18.277
I’ve had enough of stealing. I want you to give me his name.

00:18:18.458 --> 00:18:22.741
As long as you don’t have enough to pay this price, I won’t be able to tell you anything.

00:18:22.898 --> 00:18:26.867
This little purse is not bad, this phone is a piece of junk, the earrings…

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.100
They seem old !

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:40.100
I think I’m more of an expert than you. They are so mundane. Bahh how awful. But at least it can go in the gripper machine. I offer you 200 yuans for the lot.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.100
What ?!  Are you kidding me ?

00:18:42.766 --> 00:18:44.921
You know Fei, I like you a lot.

00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:52.287
By taking them at 200 yuans, I’m doing you a favor. In memory of the noble Wu Shifu and the values he used to defend.

00:18:52.667 --> 00:18:57.756
If you respect those values, why don’t you introduce me to that man who will be able to tell me who burnt down my father’s school ?

00:18:57.837 --> 00:19:01.604
Because just like his school, your father’s values are no more.

00:19:01.629 --> 00:19:06.162
What matters today is the law of the market. Money is king, "baby".

00:19:06.213 --> 00:19:11.630
Ah, it’s a shame. But in order to thrive, one must know how to adapt. Here are 200 yuans.

00:19:11.954 --> 00:19:14.703
For this price, I’d rather give this poor girls her things back

00:19:14.728 --> 00:19:19.597
Wait. That’s a very good idea you got there.

00:19:19.622 --> 00:19:27.097
If you find her, your poor girl will be able to buy them back for a high price!

00:19:27.122 --> 00:19:34.181
This awful toy must be of great sentimental value… to her. And sentiments, they are priceless.

00:19:36.604 --> 00:19:42.461
If I manage to bring you the owner of those belongings and she accepts to buy back the lot, will you finally tell me what I want to know ?

00:19:42.486 --> 00:19:44.486
A deal is a deal.

00:20:10.348 --> 00:20:13.348
I had lost all hope to find my stuff

00:20:13.373 --> 00:20:16.922
My only solution was to find the address to Uncle Wang's restaurant so that he would help me

00:20:16.972 --> 00:20:18.562
But I was totally lost

00:20:18.667 --> 00:20:21.792
*shouts in Chinese*

00:20:29.448 --> 00:20:30.125
Sorry!

00:20:31.126 --> 00:20:33.849
But you are the girl they were chasing around. They are after me now

00:20:33.874 --> 00:20:37.312
I imagine don’t understand a single word of what i’m saying

00:20:39.136 --> 00:20:41.136
I do, I speak your language, follow me

00:20:55.703 --> 00:20:58.165
They lost us. Is there a problem?

00:20:58.434 --> 00:21:01.185
I’m so happy to have found someone who understands what I’m saying.

00:21:01.365 --> 00:21:04.365
People are really nice but it’s impossible to explain what’s happening to me

00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:07.167
I think I can help you, tell me what’s going on?

00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:11.719
All my stuff was stolen, my bag, my phone, my earrings...

00:21:13.318 --> 00:21:14.318
You found them?

00:21:14.343 --> 00:21:17.343
What? This? No, a nice lady gave them to me.

00:21:17.699 --> 00:21:21.336
Can you tell me more about the real ones? Did they have a sentimental value?

00:21:21.361 --> 00:21:25.529
It's someone really dear to me that gave them to me, someone who trusted me.

00:21:28.433 --> 00:21:32.433
You know, for me too, someone stole a jewel that someone very dear entrusted me with.

00:21:32.989 --> 00:21:35.989
Like you, I’m ready to do everything I can to get it back.

00:21:36.053 --> 00:21:37.560
So, you understand me?

00:21:37.665 --> 00:21:39.175
Yes, and I will help you.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.128
Really? Thank you so much.

00:21:41.153 --> 00:21:43.591
I’d like to get back to my uncle house, he has a restaurant in Shanghai

00:21:43.616 --> 00:21:45.116
But I don’t know the address.

00:21:46.665 --> 00:21:47.665
Them again? Quick follow me!

00:21:53.703 --> 00:21:59.625
Marinette, it’s me again, with… the surprise we are very worried, please call me back

00:22:00.214 --> 00:22:02.359
I shouldn’t have let her go out alone.

00:22:02.463 --> 00:22:05.667
I’m certain that she’s okay. I will call the police

00:22:05.692 --> 00:22:07.411
And I... I will go try to find her.

00:22:07.436 --> 00:22:08.740
Are you sure?

00:22:08.765 --> 00:22:11.765
She must not be far. And I speak Chinese

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.248
stay here, I won’t be long.

00:22:15.771 --> 00:22:18.565
As Cat Noir, it will be easier to find Marinette

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.748
But, how will you explain that Cat Noir is in Shanghai?

00:22:21.773 --> 00:22:24.273
I will find something. Plagg, Claws out!

00:22:53.756 --> 00:22:56.756
This time, we should be okay. Why are you alone in Shanghai?

00:22:57.295 --> 00:23:01.604
I had gone out to meet up with a friend, until I realised someone had stolen my stuff

00:23:04.205 --> 00:23:05.205
In here.

00:23:07.832 --> 00:23:10.198
Take this, in case we cross the young men who are chasing us.

00:23:10.439 --> 00:23:12.366
Why do you have these disguises in your bag?

00:23:12.483 --> 00:23:15.276
I… I’m coming back from a costume party that’s why.

00:23:15.654 --> 00:23:17.654
Let’s take a bike. I have an idea where we could find you earrings.

00:23:18.381 --> 00:23:24.651
I know a street where there are a ton of pawn shops. The thief probably fooled one of the merchants and sold your stuff while pretending it was theirs.

00:23:24.938 --> 00:23:30.687
Uh, okay. Do you think we could find the number of my uncle's restaurant so that I might call him? He must be worried.

00:23:31.068 --> 00:23:34.516
Uh, I don’t have enough credit. I can’t call anyone anymore sorry.

00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:38.031
Don’t worry, I’m certain you will soon be able to reassure him in person.

00:23:40.537 --> 00:23:42.042
By the way, what’s your name?

00:23:42.329 --> 00:23:43.448
Fei.

00:23:43.473 --> 00:23:47.380
I’m Marinette. I’m so lucky to have found you.

00:23:51.923 --> 00:23:55.609
Ni Hao! Don’t be afraid, I’m Cat Noir, Parisian superhero.

00:23:55.634 --> 00:23:58.266
From Paris? But what are you doing in China?

00:23:58.291 --> 00:24:01.034
I’m searching for a young French who got lost in Shanghai.

00:24:01.059 --> 00:24:05.027
So, French superheroes take care of lost tourists too?

00:24:05.052 --> 00:24:08.699
Yes, added to everything else. We have the sense of public service.

00:24:08.724 --> 00:24:11.720
Sorry, I haven’t seen this girl. Good luck in your search.

00:24:14.225 --> 00:24:17.709
Ugh, I knew I should’ve taken Chinese lessons.

00:24:18.277 --> 00:24:21.277
And you? Why do you speak French?

00:24:21.678 --> 00:24:30.340
My father loved this language, and he wanted me to speak it. And his Kung Fu’ school had lost all it’s chinese customers so he was hoping to teach it to tourists.

00:24:30.365 --> 00:24:34.365
But, his school got swept in flames, and with it, everything my father believed in.

00:24:34.808 --> 00:24:36.808
Not everything apparently, since you are here.

00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:42.112
You are wrong, I became the contrary of what he believed in.

00:24:42.313 --> 00:24:45.576
I don’t understand, did he want you to be a coward, selfish and mean?

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:51.409
What are you saying? Fei, it’s been hours that you are helping me, even though we don’t know each other.

00:24:51.485 --> 00:24:55.029
And you have been really courageous when you confronted the young men who were following me

00:24:55.054 --> 00:25:01.054
You are an amazing girl, so if that's the contrary of what your dad wanted.

00:25:01.873 --> 00:25:03.658
I’m not as amazing as you think.

00:25:06.178 --> 00:25:07.178
We have arrived

00:25:08.637 --> 00:25:12.267
[Chinese talking] It’s Marinette, leave a message, BEEP!

00:25:14.614 --> 00:25:17.342
You’re on Adrien Agreste’s voicemail, please, leave a message.

00:25:18.563 --> 00:25:23.563
It’s gonna work out, it’s gonna work out.
I hope so too, I hope so.

00:25:27.068 --> 00:25:29.197
Look at this side, and I’ll go that way

00:25:38.818 --> 00:25:44.952
Here! I found it!
My mirac… I mean, my earrings!

00:25:45.419 --> 00:25:47.257
Wow, that was lucky!

00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:53.963
Hello sir! I absolutely have to get these earrings back! they are very very very important for me. I’m so happy to finally find them!

00:25:53.988 --> 00:25:58.988
Can you translate please! It won’t be necessary, I speak your language.

00:25:59.902 --> 00:26:01.215
So...

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.502
These earrings are very precious to you.

00:26:05.527 --> 00:26:07.573
Yes! Infinitely precious

00:26:07.598 --> 00:26:10.261
100 000 Yuan and they are yours

00:26:10.808 --> 00:26:14.042
100 000 Yuan you say, is that a lot?

00:26:14.067 --> 00:26:18.082
[Speaking Chinese]

00:26:18.473 --> 00:26:23.723
It is the law of supply and demand, "baby".
If it’s precious to her, it’s precious to me!

00:26:23.748 --> 00:26:29.270
[Speaking Chinese]

00:26:29.295 --> 00:26:32.723
Your attitude is revolting, you take advantage of people's misfortune to enrich yourself.

00:26:32.748 --> 00:26:36.660
I remind you that it was you who stole this girl's things and brought her to me...

00:26:36.685 --> 00:26:40.712
So tell me, which one of us benefits more from the misfortune of people?

00:26:41.951 --> 00:26:43.036
Marinette.

00:26:43.061 --> 00:26:44.780
Tikki!I'll get you out of there soon

00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:46.761
Don’t insist Fei, I’ll pay.

00:26:46.819 --> 00:26:48.714
But it’s a huge amount of money!

00:26:48.739 --> 00:26:52.739
I’m gonna call my uncle and explain him everything. Can I borrow your phone?

00:26:53.459 --> 00:26:56.546
Can you give me the phone number of the restaurant "milles délices" please?

00:26:56.571 --> 00:27:01.571
I know it. Your uncle is a great cook!
Yes, and I’m so ashamed to ask him…

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:08.213
[Speaks Chinese]

00:27:17.846 --> 00:27:19.502
Here is the phone number.

00:27:19.527 --> 00:27:22.909
Thank you sir, it’s very nice of you!

00:27:29.052 --> 00:27:30.342
We’ll do it another way!

00:27:30.367 --> 00:27:31.242
But, Fei!

00:27:31.267 --> 00:27:34.940
if you don't buy this jewellery now, I can't promise to keep it for you.

00:27:34.965 --> 00:27:37.884
if another customer is interested I will sell it to them

00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:42.284
Fei!I can't afford to take such a risk.
Believe me,believe me, nobody will buy them at that price!

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.175
Fei! What are you playing at! You don't want an answer to your question anymore?

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.088
Don't you want to know who attacked your father?
Have you forgotten who you are?

00:27:50.113 --> 00:27:53.113
on the contrary, I just remembered who I really am!

00:27:56.599 --> 00:28:00.599
I'll take you back to your uncle! Fei, I can’t leave without my…

00:28:01.512 --> 00:28:02.934
Get on the bike quickly.

00:28:03.559 --> 00:28:05.184
You stole my earrings?

00:28:05.209 --> 00:28:07.355
But you wanted to get them at any cost right?

00:28:07.387 --> 00:28:09.996
Yes but not like that. Stealing is very wrong!

00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:16.228
This shopkeeper paid a lot of money for my earrings to the person who sold them to him. If he can’t resell them, he will have lost his money!

00:28:16.253 --> 00:28:19.994
Marinette, I promise you I’ll explain everything to you but you have to get on this bike

00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:21.306
RIGHT NOW!

00:28:28.322 --> 00:28:30.275
Where did the little red toy go?

00:28:36.494 --> 00:28:41.291
She made a fool out of me!
This little brat set me up!

00:28:41.316 --> 00:28:42.275
Catch them!

00:28:42.634 --> 00:28:45.150
This poor man may have gotten into debt to afford them.

00:28:47.135 --> 00:28:49.650
Marinette, stop arguing and run!

00:28:56.975 --> 00:28:58.756
See? Those men are furious!

00:28:59.334 --> 00:29:00.850
You have no idea.

00:29:11.928 --> 00:29:12.741
Tikki!

00:29:18.362 --> 00:29:18.722
Tikki, sp-

00:29:18.747 --> 00:29:19.410
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:29:19.435 --> 00:29:21.987
We can’t get lost, those ones are really dangerous

00:29:22.012 --> 00:29:27.777
What do you mean really dangerous? The other ones also seemed really dangerous when they were chasing me.

00:29:34.136 --> 00:29:35.886
Fei, let me go get help.

00:29:35.918 --> 00:29:38.277
The only one that can help us here is me…

00:29:42.308 --> 00:29:45.230
and the kung fu my father taught me.

00:29:47.887 --> 00:29:48.418
What’s happening?

00:29:48.443 --> 00:29:55.496
Us, proud vigilantes of the streets, fight against evil even when it strikes other representatives of evil…

00:29:55.521 --> 00:29:56.778
Go home! It’s dangerous!

00:29:56.958 --> 00:29:58.699
We’re not taking orders from a thief!

00:29:58.934 --> 00:29:59.686
A thief?

00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:01.758
Uh don’t listen to him, he’s talking nonsense.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:06.440
Run!

00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:26.671
Ah this city is too big. I’ll never make it alone.

00:30:28.859 --> 00:30:29.796
Oh!

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:35.974
My Lady, a French girl we know, Marinette Dupain-Cheng, is missing in Shanghai.

00:30:35.999 --> 00:30:39.237
I’m already there. If you get this message, meet me there, I need your help.

00:30:47.656 --> 00:30:49.765
Finally, the time has come

00:30:49.868 --> 00:30:51.757
Master, I beg you... Give up!

00:30:51.782 --> 00:30:54.725
You are going to free a magic that is way too powerful for you.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:59.022
The magic guardian of the prodigious is a dreadful opponent.
You will never defeat him.

00:30:59.164 --> 00:31:01.952
What makes you think I'm going to confront him?

00:31:02.578 --> 00:31:03.280
Where are we?

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.390
At my home. That’s where I live.

00:31:05.703 --> 00:31:08.436
Marinette Dupain-Cheng?

00:31:09.721 --> 00:31:11.244
This is where I have to be right now

00:31:12.534 --> 00:31:13.276
Now..

00:31:20.199 --> 00:31:22.113
Sorry, I don’t have anything else to offer you

00:31:27.504 --> 00:31:29.769
Fei, why did you bring us here?

00:31:29.794 --> 00:31:31.956
I have to look after my father’s heritage.

00:31:32.347 --> 00:31:34.457
But your father…

00:31:34.613 --> 00:31:37.073
He disappeared... along with his school.

00:31:37.098 --> 00:31:39.105
Oh. I’m really sorry.

00:31:39.339 --> 00:31:41.136
They did everything to make us leave.

00:31:41.161 --> 00:31:42.191
I mean everything.

00:31:42.216 --> 00:31:45.706
Intimidation, robbery, they took everything from us.

00:31:45.731 --> 00:31:47.776
Even the bracelet my father had entrusted me with.

00:31:47.801 --> 00:31:54.105
This jewel I told you about and to which I was as attached to as you are to your earrings. Except… this jewel had a power.

00:31:54.613 --> 00:31:56.722
Gasp- who are those people you’re telling me about?

00:31:56.879 --> 00:31:58.957
That’s the thing, I don’t know.

00:31:59.139 --> 00:32:02.566
It was my quest to find their identity that put you in my way..

00:32:02.591 --> 00:32:05.410
I have to tell you something, I-..

00:32:05.435 --> 00:32:08.100
Did you really think you could get away from me Fei?

00:32:09.936 --> 00:32:10.936
You two know each other?

00:32:13.038 --> 00:32:14.670
Of course we know each other..

00:32:14.695 --> 00:32:18.474
How do you think I ended up with earrings, little girl?

00:32:18.499 --> 00:32:20.209
Because she stole them from you!

00:32:20.234 --> 00:32:22.724
and then she stole them from me!

00:32:23.933 --> 00:32:27.946
that’s.. that’s what I was about to tell you, Marinette I swear..

00:32:28.428 --> 00:32:30.928
You saw how much these earrings meant to me!

00:32:30.953 --> 00:32:34.061
and you knew I was willing to pay any price!

00:32:34.086 --> 00:32:38.100
I’m sorry, he said he knew someone who could tell me what happened to my dad..

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.732
but for that he asks me for a huge amount of money in exchange!

00:32:40.757 --> 00:32:44.100
Truth has a price.. You can't get anything without having something, "baby"...

00:32:44.443 --> 00:32:46.373
You’re gonna call your uncle now!

00:32:46.398 --> 00:32:48.273
and ask him for the money he owes me!

00:32:50.394 --> 00:32:51.779
I won’t let you.

00:32:51.804 --> 00:32:52.747
Run away Marinette!

00:32:52.772 --> 00:32:54.888
this limitless greed..

00:32:54.913 --> 00:32:57.856
Years ago too... it had served my plans well..

00:33:02.818 --> 00:33:05.373
Nooroo, Dark Wings Rise!

00:33:19.458 --> 00:33:22.366
I want my money.

00:33:22.391 --> 00:33:26.006
And you’re gonna give it to me, or you’re never gonna get your answers!

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.749
Do you only know the answers to my questions?

00:33:28.774 --> 00:33:33.372
The truth, the truth is that if this girl doesn’t call her uncle now..

00:33:33.397 --> 00:33:35.585
You will know the same fate as your father!

00:33:39.162 --> 00:33:41.162
I forbid you to speak of my father!

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:46.210
I may have betrayed these teachings, but it’s over, I’ll find my answers alone!

00:33:46.594 --> 00:33:50.135
Marinette I’m the only one who can protect you!

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.870
You weren't protecting me... All you did was lie

00:33:52.895 --> 00:33:54.692
I need you to trust me

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:55.670
Impossible!

00:33:55.695 --> 00:33:58.404
I shouldn’t have stolen your earrings, forgive me!

00:33:58.429 --> 00:34:01.263
You did what you had to do and this time it’s my turn.

00:34:07.458 --> 00:34:10.028
Silver King, I’m Hawk Moth

00:34:10.053 --> 00:34:14.338
you want to become, rich?
hiding behind this waterfall is a very precious object

00:34:14.363 --> 00:34:17.496
If you help me get hold of it, I'd make you immensely rich,

00:34:17.521 --> 00:34:19.949
Beyond everything you could imagine..

00:34:19.974 --> 00:34:21.808
a deal is a deal.

00:34:24.147 --> 00:34:28.147
the silver blades of your fan will be able to slice everything...

00:34:28.172 --> 00:34:31.543
The silver blades of your fan will be able to decide everything

00:34:34.553 --> 00:34:36.553
My wealth, the rich

00:34:36.578 --> 00:34:39.261
It looks like Hawk Moth also took a trip to Shanghai!

00:34:39.286 --> 00:34:41.427
Do you think that Fei is really sincere, Marinette?

00:34:41.452 --> 00:34:43.452
I don’t know yet but for now..

00:34:44.953 --> 00:34:46.953
Tikki, spots on!

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:12.376
M'Lady, a French girl we know, Marinette Dupain-Cheng has disappeared in Shanghai. I'm already on place. If you have this message, join me. I need your help.

00:35:12.562 --> 00:35:13.562
Ooh, Sweet Kitty.

00:35:16.855 --> 00:35:18.075
Meow My Lady.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.100
I just arrived in Shanghai Kitty. You find her?

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.100
No but with you, I'm sure we can do miracles

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:27.100
For tell you everything, there is not only her in Shanghai. I just saw an akuma.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.700
What! I'm coming very soon.

00:35:29.725 --> 00:35:30.725
Comes quickly Cat Noir.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.426
It's the time to prove that the money opens all the doors.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.273
Nobody will enter in the sacred Cave.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.100
Who do you think you are scaring, little girl!

00:35:52.302 --> 00:35:53.302
You're wasting our time.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.419
And time is money!

00:35:55.444 --> 00:35:57.444
"Aaaaaaah"

00:36:11.621 --> 00:36:12.621
Catch that.

00:36:29.802 --> 00:36:31.802
Where is the fortune that you promised me!

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.867
It comes, it comes, keep calm.

00:36:37.761 --> 00:36:38.761
"Gasp"

00:36:39.347 --> 00:36:39.946
Who are you?

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:40.100
Who is you.

00:36:40.125 --> 00:36:41.125
Ladybug.

00:36:41.326 --> 00:36:42.075
I'm Fei

00:36:42.125 --> 00:36:44.267
You are one of the good guys?

00:36:44.659 --> 00:36:45.232
Yes

00:36:48.953 --> 00:36:52.758
I will finally be able to check if this investment was profitable.

00:36:52.783 --> 00:36:58.814
So you were my mysterious buyer! An uninteresting trinket like that never brought me so much money!

00:36:58.839 --> 00:37:00.318
*Cruel laugh*

00:37:08.537 --> 00:37:11.537
I have been waiting for this moment for 15 long years now.

00:37:15.869 --> 00:37:16.869
Oh it's my bracelet!

00:37:17.026 --> 00:37:18.026
Does he have any special features?

00:37:18.784 --> 00:37:22.784
I don't know. I just have to protect the Cave and the Bracelet, but I've failed.

00:37:24.472 --> 00:37:25.228
"Ooooh!"

00:37:29.187 --> 00:37:34.577
Human, are you ready to affront the judgment of Meishi, the Lion, protector of the "Prodigious".

00:37:34.939 --> 00:37:35.939
The "Prodigious"

00:37:35.964 --> 00:37:36.964
You know what is it?

00:37:37.385 --> 00:37:42.385
No, but if HawkMoth wants to seize, I must have taken everything to prevent it. You stay here!

00:37:50.955 --> 00:37:55.955
Put the Prodigious on your neck, Human, and get ready to face my judgment.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:00.299
What makes you think I have the slightest attention to confront you Guardian.

00:38:00.324 --> 00:38:06.105
Money King it's the time to respect our contract. Transform him into a Gold Statue.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:11.100
Hein, what. I forbid you! You don't respect the rules!

00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:16.079
Nooooooo!

00:38:17.927 --> 00:38:18.927
I take over my father's mission!

00:38:20.513 --> 00:38:21.513
Fei, I told you to stay hidden!

00:38:22.037 --> 00:38:25.358
So it's you who will affront my judgment, Human.

00:38:35.407 --> 00:38:36.407
Hurry up Cat Noir.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.302
Greetings to our new "Renren"!

00:39:00.826 --> 00:39:01.826
New what?

00:39:02.124 --> 00:39:04.142
"Renren", the person who wear the "Prodigious".

00:39:05.065 --> 00:39:06.065
Who are you talking to?

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:09.898
Only the "Renren" can see us.

00:39:10.143 --> 00:39:14.143
Has species of magic bugs but only I can see them apparently

00:39:14.168 --> 00:39:16.168
No! The Prodigious is mine! King-Money!

00:39:19.578 --> 00:39:22.578
We are the Renlings, the spirits of human values.

00:39:22.603 --> 00:39:27.507
Anyone of us can transform you into a wild animal, provided that you are worthy of the values ​​that it represent.

00:39:28.969 --> 00:39:35.944
For example, if you want that me, "Tang-Tang" Renling of patience you wants I to transform you into a praying mentis, you have to be patient.

00:39:35.989 --> 00:39:38.601
Thank you, I don't have for patience now, sorry.

00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:40.626
"Xung-Xung, Renling of calm

00:39:40.651 --> 00:39:42.060
Of Calm! It's a joke!

00:39:42.085 --> 00:39:45.085
Calm like a Bear, Big and strong like a Bear.

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.100
"Breathing"

00:39:51.888 --> 00:39:52.644
Xung!

00:40:01.792 --> 00:40:02.792
Not bad!

00:40:03.537 --> 00:40:05.782
Thanks umm…
Ladybear apparently

00:40:06.031 --> 00:40:06.695
For now!

00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:12.138
Lucky charm !

00:40:13.087 --> 00:40:14.865
What are you going to do with that ?

00:40:16.732 --> 00:40:18.174
I don’t know yet.

00:40:25.693 --> 00:40:26.914
Tang !

00:40:28.876 --> 00:40:32.445
Okay, I’m beginning to understand how it works. Xiong !

00:40:36.198 --> 00:40:38.198
Xie !

00:40:40.298 --> 00:40:43.603
The akuma is in his fan. We have to destroy it in order to free him.

00:40:43.628 --> 00:40:45.634
Got it. Lang !

00:40:50.508 --> 00:40:51.923
What’s happening ?

00:40:51.948 --> 00:40:54.948
Normally, if I turn into a dragon I can control all the elements.

00:40:54.973 --> 00:40:57.973
I’d really like to toast his armor with lightning, but it’s not working.

00:40:59.059 --> 00:41:02.450
The power of the dragon is the most powerful of them all.

00:41:02.475 --> 00:41:06.166
Your intentions need to be just, and noble for you to earn the right to use it

00:41:06.211 --> 00:41:07.816
Of course my intentions are noble !

00:41:07.841 --> 00:41:09.991
I want revenge from the man who ruined my life.

00:41:10.016 --> 00:41:15.742
Revenge is against the dragon’s values.
Your intentions and your judgement are troubled.

00:41:15.767 --> 00:41:17.767
Isn’t revenge the same thing as justice ?

00:41:18.067 --> 00:41:21.067
So we’ll defeat him another way. Ho !

00:41:37.381 --> 00:41:38.150
No !

00:41:38.175 --> 00:41:43.175
Who would have thought, the prodigious and your miraculous on the same day!

00:41:55.952 --> 00:41:57.952
Cataclysm !

00:42:01.511 --> 00:42:04.511
Nooo !

00:42:05.006 --> 00:42:06.210
Where is my money ?

00:42:08.496 --> 00:42:11.496
You’re alone against 3 of us Hawkmoth. It’s over.

00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:14.599
I think you mean it’s over for you.

00:42:22.091 --> 00:42:24.544
Yan Woshi, I am Hawkmoth.

00:42:24.569 --> 00:42:30.569
You will certainly not let this girl, who gets revenge and justice confused, be the holder of your prodigious.

00:42:30.594 --> 00:42:37.594
As the Yama infernal sovereign, I will sow carnage and destruction until she gives me back the jewel !

00:42:47.927 --> 00:42:50.658
We have to break the ball, the akuma is inside.

00:42:53.745 --> 00:42:55.216
Tremble, humans !

00:42:56.075 --> 00:42:57.169
Ah!

00:42:57.756 --> 00:43:00.851
Adrien! No! Not the City!

00:43:00.876 --> 00:43:03.876
Yan Woshi ! Stop or I’ll take back your power-

00:43:04.641 --> 00:43:07.641
I take orders from no one !

00:43:09.322 --> 00:43:13.322
Okay… Is that good or bad news ?

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:21.010
We recharge and regroup to think of a plan.

00:43:44.483 --> 00:43:46.483
Ying !

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:51.130
Roa !

00:43:58.199 --> 00:44:00.251
Hua !

00:44:09.637 --> 00:44:10.969
Everything is my fault.

00:44:10.994 --> 00:44:14.994
Give me the prodigious back. You are not worthy of wearing it.

00:44:15.736 --> 00:44:16.437
He is right.

00:44:16.462 --> 00:44:17.462
No !

00:44:17.818 --> 00:44:19.300
You’re the only one who can defeat him.

00:44:19.325 --> 00:44:23.325
Only the power of the dragon can reach the akumatized object inside of him.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:27.350
I want to be able to use the power of the dragon. But I am not worthy of it.

00:44:27.375 --> 00:44:29.081
You can do it.

00:44:29.106 --> 00:44:31.106
No, I can never do anything.

00:44:31.756 --> 00:44:34.537
- Wait !
- Ying !

00:44:39.159 --> 00:44:42.011
We don’t have a choice anymore. I’m gonna use my power on him.

00:44:42.036 --> 00:44:45.036
Cat Noir ! No !

00:44:45.274 --> 00:44:47.274
Cataclysm !

00:44:49.255 --> 00:44:51.255
No !

00:45:13.418 --> 00:45:13.789
Fei

00:45:14.911 --> 00:45:18.911
Uhhh - Marinette!

00:45:19.698 --> 00:45:21.698
I’m sorry for not forgiving you earlier

00:45:21.994 --> 00:45:29.029
No Marinette! I don’t deserve that you forgive me, I lied to you, I stole your things, and everythings is happening now is my fault

00:45:29.054 --> 00:45:32.657
I can’t imagine the sadness of my father if he saw how I failed

00:45:32.999 --> 00:45:36.040
I know now that you did all of that for a right reason

00:45:36.107 --> 00:45:39.927
Maybe, but i failed to live by my father’s values

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:43.755
He would never have devoted all his energy to getting revenge on someone

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.942
He would have continued to do good around him

00:45:45.967 --> 00:45:47.967
So, you know what you have to do

00:45:54.068 --> 00:45:56.068
My prodigious!

00:46:08.313 --> 00:46:10.339
Lang!

00:46:17.573 --> 00:46:20.573
Meishi ! Stop destroying everything!

00:46:34.975 --> 00:46:36.809
Tikki, spots on!

00:46:37.808 --> 00:46:39.808
Lucky Charm!

00:46:51.327 --> 00:46:53.327
Perfect!

00:46:57.041 --> 00:46:58.041
Calm down, Meishi!

00:46:58.066 --> 00:47:02.673
I don’t want to hurt you, i’m not here to destroy you neither to satisfy my revenge

00:47:02.698 --> 00:47:05.892
I’m only trying to save you and bring you back to your sense

00:47:06.068 --> 00:47:07.068
I’m no longer Meishi

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:08.740
I’m Yaloshi

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:17.490
I went on a shopping spree

00:47:17.613 --> 00:47:20.613
Red and black spots? Funny pattern for a Chinese vase

00:47:21.105 --> 00:47:25.634
It’s because it’s not a chinese vase, but the solution for our problem.

00:47:25.659 --> 00:47:30.971
A giant pill to swallow with plenty of water!
If you see what i’m saying

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:33.250
I see absolutely, yes

00:47:36.651 --> 00:47:37.651
Yaloshi!

00:47:38.523 --> 00:47:41.265
You came finally to give me what is mine?

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:43.290
Yes, but before, take a large glass of water to calm you down

00:48:05.132 --> 00:48:06.421
And Voila!

00:48:07.101 --> 00:48:09.210
No more evil doing for you little akuma

00:48:12.999 --> 00:48:14.584
Time to de-evilize

00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:19.289
Gotcha!

00:48:20.351 --> 00:48:22.530
Bye Bye little butterfly

00:48:28.248 --> 00:48:32.726
What happened? You have acceded to the power of the Dragon?

00:48:32.751 --> 00:48:34.751
Yes, with a little bit of help!

00:48:35.443 --> 00:48:36.443
Pound it!

00:48:39.787 --> 00:48:41.827
Was I the one who caused so much damage?

00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:45.016
What a terrible breach of my mission.

00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:50.041
Don’t worry, we’ll take care of fixing everything for you. Miraculous Ladybug!

00:48:58.885 --> 00:48:59.885
Kitty!

00:49:00.807 --> 00:49:04.342
You wrote for the good of all and renounced your revenge.

00:49:04.367 --> 00:49:11.425
You have all the human values required, The Prodigious is in good hand with you, Renren.

00:49:22.912 --> 00:49:27.089
Come on, we forget the past, okay? Just tell me how much do you want?

00:49:27.114 --> 00:49:30.562
Wait! Wait! We can find a solution

00:49:30.587 --> 00:49:35.901
You destroyed my father’s school, you made me an orphan that you forced to steal for you.

00:49:35.926 --> 00:49:39.911
Because of you I renounced all the ancestral values that my father taught me.

00:49:39.936 --> 00:49:44.469
From the beginning you are the source of all the misfortunes that happened to me! Why?

00:49:44.494 --> 00:49:45.354
Money!

00:49:45.405 --> 00:49:51.917
There are no word to describe what you are, but today I decided...

00:49:52.281 --> 00:49:55.198
to let justice take its course.

00:49:55.223 --> 00:49:58.223
Well done, Fei! It’s worthy of a wise "Renren" - full of wisdom

00:50:09.075 --> 00:50:10.341
It’s not too early!

00:50:10.366 --> 00:50:13.034
I was wondering when you were going to decide to put it back on.

00:50:13.059 --> 00:50:14.550
Meishi!

00:50:14.575 --> 00:50:16.591
You thought that my mission was over?

00:50:16.912 --> 00:50:18.494
But it just started

00:50:19.676 --> 00:50:22.771
Ladybug, Cat Noir thank you for your help.

00:50:22.796 --> 00:50:25.015
Well all we have left to do is find Marinette.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.075
Oh. Yes exactly, we’re here for that after all, finding Marinette!

00:50:28.876 --> 00:50:31.876
Don’t worry, I found her and put her in a shelter during the battle.

00:50:32.021 --> 00:50:37.021
Ying! Are you interested in a little visit to the Shanghai court?

00:50:40.678 --> 00:50:43.075
Uhm, so I suppose that we are going back to Paris together?

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.100
Uhm, yes why not, I mean if you insist.

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:52.993
Hey, tell me in your opinion, if we want to do a world tour, is it faster to pass by the Arctic or Antarctic?

00:50:53.018 --> 00:50:59.408
Oh what interesting question that I always asked myself but never had the opportunity to answer it, haha.

00:50:59.663 --> 00:51:04.860
You know what? I think that we should test that right now and when we see each other again in Paris we can compare our scores.

00:51:05.476 --> 00:51:08.075
That is an excellent idea Kitty, so i will go that way.

00:51:08.381 --> 00:51:10.751
And I will go that way, until then M’lady.

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:27.443
You know Marinette, during a birthday, the tradition wants you to inhale the biggest noodle without breaking it. It symbolizes longevity.

00:51:29.075 --> 00:51:34.075
Here in China the 60th birthday is often the first that we celebrate.

00:51:34.222 --> 00:51:35.222
What?! You never celebrated your birthday before?

00:51:37.261 --> 00:51:42.404
Never, and I am really happy to celebrate it for
the first time with you and your boyfriend Adrien.

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.075
Uhm we are only friends.

00:51:45.873 --> 00:51:47.991
Come on it is time for you to open your present.

00:51:52.166 --> 00:51:55.135
Sorry, we didn’t mean to scare you, we only wanted to give you this back.

00:51:56.672 --> 00:51:59.442
Oh, wow my k… my fetish necklace.

00:51:59.467 --> 00:52:01.075
Thank you so much, thank you a thousand times.

00:52:01.713 --> 00:52:03.071
Bring in your friends.

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:13.059
An accordion? It’s a present from Sabine, Marinette’s mom. I raised her and I always dreamt of playing the accordion

00:52:13.591 --> 00:52:15.075
but I never had the time.

00:52:16.099 --> 00:52:17.465
I know how to play, if you want.

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:40.625
Congratulations Marinette, you seem to have found the magical ingredient of this meal finally.

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:46.878
Thank you but i think that if there is a magical ingredient it’s sister Marinette. Does it bother you if I call you sister.

00:52:46.903 --> 00:52:50.441
On the contrary, it’s a pleasure sister Fei. How do we say that in Mandarin?

00:52:50.466 --> 00:52:51.466
Chei Chei.

00:52:51.661 --> 00:52:52.661
Chei Chei Fei.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:56.050
What did I say?

00:52:56.075 --> 00:52:59.075
It would be too awkward to translate, Marinette.

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.428
If you want, when we go back to Paris, I could teach you Chinese.

00:53:02.453 --> 00:53:05.100
Otay… I mean yato I mean… ugh.

00:53:06.135 --> 00:53:08.694
Sometimes it’s hard to understand her even in French.

00:53:09.627 --> 00:53:13.968
Coming to China I found more than anything I could have hoped for.

00:53:14.164 --> 00:53:19.476
An incredible uncle, a new friend and a new Chinese teacher.

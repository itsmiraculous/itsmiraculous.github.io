WEBVTT

00:00:01.647 --> 00:00:02.704
In the daytime, I'm Marinette

00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:04.889
Just a normal girl, with a normal life.

00:00:05.831 --> 00:00:08.189
But there's something about me that no one knows yet

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.007
Because I have a secret

00:00:11.398 --> 00:00:12.193
Miraculous

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.107
Simply the best!

00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:17.223
Up to the test when things go wrong!

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:20.137
Miraculous, the luckiest.

00:00:20.427 --> 00:00:23.285
The power of love always so strong!

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.419
Miraculous!

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.904
Miraculous!

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.771
Wow! You're strong bugaboo!

00:00:33.974 --> 00:00:36.131
We've never fought a villain this fast before! Pound it?!

00:00:37.773 --> 00:00:39.773
Bugaboo? Is there a problem??

00:00:40.717 --> 00:00:42.321
Pound it! Yes yes, hehehe…

00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:47.063
We need to recheck if everything's fine in Paris, should we do a Patrol?

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.884
Don't you wanna tell me what's wrong instead?

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.975
You didn't even react when I called you bugaboo!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.905
What do you want me to tell you? Yes everything's going very well!

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.396
I just got some time left but don't wanna talk

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I know the ideal place so we won't talk

00:00:58.596 --> 00:00:59.492
Perfect! I'm following you!

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:00.516
*romantic movie plays*

00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:03.569
You led me into a trap

00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:06.095
Shhh, I thought you didn't want to talk

00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:08.924
shh!

00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:15.950
No!

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:18.183
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Don't tell him anything else!!

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:19.208
Talk less loud!

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:22.452
But romantic movies are lame, do you want me to tell you why??
It's not realistic for one second!

00:01:22.477 --> 00:01:26.403
In real life the girl takes a crazy long time to tell
him she loves him without stuttering, blablabla!!

00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:27.833
And how do you know if he loves her too??

00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:31.017
IMPOSSIBLE!! So she decides she's never gonna be able to be with him, and BOOM!

00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:32.454
She falls in love with someone else

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.738
And everything is too simple, too easy

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:37.885
No stammering, they hold and kiss kiss, and surprise!

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.000
The girl has secrets, and the boy hates secrets, normal!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
They they have to breakup and the whole is miserable forever, the end

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.043
It's so whatever the romantic comedy

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:49.803
Sorry!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Quick, let’s go…

00:01:52.216 --> 00:01:54.343
A bit of advice, don’t go see romantic comedies,

00:01:54.368 --> 00:01:58.080
you should go see heroic superheroic, special effects, no feelings,

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:00.658
no questions, no one is talking because they have nothing to say to one another

00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:02.683
At least, you will have a good time!

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.969
Sorry…

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.250
Listen, My Lady, I didn’t understand everything you said, and I don’t know anything about your personal life obviously.

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:12.387
But I know what a broken heart is, and to me, it seems like this is it.

00:02:12.412 --> 00:02:14.433
Me, a broken heart? I don’t know what you are talking about.

00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:16.250
Everything is going perfect in the best world

00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:17.975
I want to go swimming, don't you? Let’s go to the swimming pool!

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:20.000
You know that if you need to talk, I’m always here for you.

00:02:20.025 --> 00:02:21.268
To the swimming pool !

00:02:21.293 --> 00:02:22.349
Wohoo!

00:02:36.478 --> 00:02:38.478
It’s so sad

00:02:38.503 --> 00:02:40.503
I told you that we should remove these pictures

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:44.209
Stop! I’m not sad and these pictures do not disturb me.

00:02:44.234 --> 00:02:46.683
Not at all, these are just pictures of my friends

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:50.303
and i love fashion and my friends of course so, leave them in their places

00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:51.468
There is no problem

00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:57.120
So, Marinette has a problem: she is lovesick!

00:02:57.145 --> 00:02:58.734
At the beginning, she was in love with Adrien

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:02.938
But, she never manages to tell him because
this is Marinette we're talking about and he’s Adrien...

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.952
Then Luka enters the stage..

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Marinette gets to talk to him because... it’s Luka and they get together...

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.826
both of them were cute..

00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:13.851
ok but they broke up.

00:03:13.884 --> 00:03:15.144
yes..[mumbles]

00:03:18.518 --> 00:03:22.494
but the bottom line is, Marinette never told us anything about it..

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.000
if Luka had not told his sister Juleka who told Rose who told Myléne who told Alix who ended up telling me...

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.262
And I’m her best friend! I still wouldn’t know!

00:03:31.287 --> 00:03:34.276
Yesterday in school I was in the bathroom and I heard her crying...

00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:36.301
Marinette, are you crying?

00:03:37.048 --> 00:03:40.177
I cry? Haha, not at all I’ve never been so happy in my life...

00:03:40.202 --> 00:03:44.087
We should throw a great party, I’m so happy!

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.696
But why is she hiding these secrets from us like that?

00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:49.461
if she doesn’t even say anything to Alya there’s a real problem...

00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:50.258
What do we do?

00:03:50.283 --> 00:03:52.657
what Marinette needs is a discussion between friends !

00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:54.682
I propose to call her all together to talk about it !

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Rabbit check !

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.899
I think I will fall on her answering machine.
It’s Marinette, leave a message, Beep!

00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:09.406
Hi, Marinette, it’s us!

00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:10.005
Hello!

00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:14.040
Just to tell you that we are here if you want to talk, when you want and where you want.

00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:16.329
Call us back, we love you, kisses

00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:21.179
We must intervene, we need Tikki, I’ll take care

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Why don’t you communicate with your friends on the talking device

00:04:25.374 --> 00:04:27.374
To tell them what? Everything is okay

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:30.824
Maybe you should detransform yourself, so

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.596
No, I’m better off like that, if Shadow Moth attacks Paris, I’ll immediately be ready to take action.

00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:39.934
Okay, but did you think of Tikki,
maybe she would like to rest a little bit or have a bite to eat.

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.419
Oh no, TIKKI- Spots off!

00:04:44.237 --> 00:04:45.000
Are you okay, Tikki?

00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:47.040
Definitely better than you Marinette!

00:04:47.065 --> 00:04:49.331
We should discuss, don’t you think?

00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:51.656
Girls, don’t you think we should go to her house?

00:04:51.842 --> 00:04:53.810
We could offer her an eternal friendship bracelet

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:57.704
so that she doesn’t forget that friends can tell everything
and that we are always here for her!

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.605
I read in an old magazine that an ancient tribe of America did that!

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.502
We confide a secret with the pearl mentally, once Marinette has confided her secret with the pearl, this bracelet will unite us all six!

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.830
Woww, are you ready?

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:16.647
Wouldn’t it be easier, to just take her for an
orange juice to discuss her love stories?

00:05:18.197 --> 00:05:18.835
-Okay

00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:22.338
As long as I’m Ladybug, I can’t have a love story

00:05:23.247 --> 00:05:24.247
What makes you say that Marinette?!

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.883
You know very well Tikki!

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:30.475
I had to leave Luka because I couldn’t tell him the truth,
and it would be the same for Adrien

00:05:30.645 --> 00:05:32.638
I can’t share my secret with anyone

00:05:32.663 --> 00:05:36.857
I can’t be honest with my best friend or with my parents or with anyone!

00:05:36.882 --> 00:05:39.351
I’m condemned to lie, all the time, for everyone.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.975
What can I do Tikki?

00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:46.290
I would like to help you, but- Kwamis don’t fall in love

00:05:46.906 --> 00:05:51.102
Do you see? No one can help me, the life of Marinette is so complicated

00:05:51.134 --> 00:05:52.932
Maybe it's better if I'm Ladybug all time!

00:05:53.113 --> 00:05:54.176
Tikki, SPOTS ON!

00:05:57.637 --> 00:06:00.246
Marinette! Oh-- Marinette!

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.928
Wow

00:06:03.953 --> 00:06:05.702
Come and see, girls! There's something new!

00:06:05.727 --> 00:06:06.352
It’ so cute

00:06:07.756 --> 00:06:09.871
Again a super new creation by Marinette!

00:06:09.976 --> 00:06:10.967
She must be at the roof

00:06:10.992 --> 00:06:11.992
I will go and get her

00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:13.973
What are you waiting for Hawkmoth?

00:06:14.276 --> 00:06:14.989
I’m ready for you

00:06:19.771 --> 00:06:20.566
Marinette?

00:06:20.591 --> 00:06:21.422
Tikki spots off

00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:22.637
Marinette!

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.670
What are you guys doing here

00:06:23.695 --> 00:06:24.917
We are here to see how are you doing

00:06:24.942 --> 00:06:25.943
Oh look this seems a new house

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:26.952
Huuuh

00:06:26.977 --> 00:06:28.938
I will remove the roof to see inside!

00:06:28.963 --> 00:06:29.174
Ahhhhh

00:06:29.242 --> 00:06:29.528
Don’t touch go back

00:06:29.553 --> 00:06:29.915
Uhhuhuhuh, listen!

00:06:32.296 --> 00:06:33.968
I’m very sorry Marinette

00:06:34.106 --> 00:06:35.483
Please get out of my room

00:06:35.508 --> 00:06:38.331
It’s nothing Marinette we will help you fix it don’t worry

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.262
Of course not! Now leave!

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:43.085
Obviously, there’s something going on

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.282
and we won’t leave until you tell us what.

00:06:45.507 --> 00:06:48.817
Each one of us here has given their secrets to this bracelet now it’s your turn.

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:50.325
I will tell you what’s wrong

00:06:50.566 --> 00:06:54.002
You all walking in my room without my permission!

00:06:55.097 --> 00:06:57.872
If we are friends you must tell us everything

00:06:57.897 --> 00:07:00.010
Real friends never let each other down.

00:07:01.234 --> 00:07:03.443
Maybe that I don’t want you as friends.

00:07:03.468 --> 00:07:05.124
Come on, get out!

00:07:23.862 --> 00:07:26.469
I had no other choice Tikki. I had to do it.

00:07:26.636 --> 00:07:28.285
I know, Marinette

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.766
Now I don’t have to lie anymore since…

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:32.680
I don’t have any friends to lie to.

00:07:32.905 --> 00:07:33.296
*sighs*

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.780
Huh? What happened?

00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:39.365
Girls!

00:07:44.404 --> 00:07:48.159
Many little fragile hearts are broken together.

00:07:48.184 --> 00:07:50.693
What a wonderful symphony for my akumas.

00:07:57.579 --> 00:07:59.444
Fly away my evil akuma.

00:07:59.469 --> 00:08:01.196
and darken their hearts!

00:08:11.572 --> 00:08:13.179
I just lost my best friend.

00:08:14.739 --> 00:08:16.360
I was hoping it would work.

00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:21.650
Waah it’s… so sad.

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:24.801
*mumbles*

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:28.886
No, it can’t end like this. No way !

00:08:30.862 --> 00:08:33.652
Gang of secrets. I am ShadowMoth.

00:08:33.708 --> 00:08:36.519
Your friend didn’t want to tell you her little secrets.

00:08:36.544 --> 00:08:40.755
I grant you all the powers you need to get them out of her by force.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.809
All I want in return are the miraculouses of LadyBug and Cat Noir.

00:08:44.834 --> 00:08:47.526
Marinette must remain our friend.

00:08:47.551 --> 00:08:49.370
No matter whether she wants it or not.

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:52.000
And she won’t keep any secrets from her friends anymore.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.590
*mumbles*

00:08:56.872 --> 00:08:59.000
I'll take care of catching her.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.616
No more secrets, she’ll have to put us on the scent

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:04.350
And I’ll turn back time to make everything as it used to be!

00:09:04.375 --> 00:09:07.000
We’ll comfort her and she’ll be our friend again.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.646
And if Ladybug and Cat Noir try to get in our way, Horrificator will keep them at bay.

00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:12.633
*rawr*

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
*sighs*

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:23.801
*gasps*

00:09:25.442 --> 00:09:28.473
I’m here for you Marinette!
I’m your best friend!

00:09:28.498 --> 00:09:30.520
You’d better tell us all your secrets!

00:09:30.545 --> 00:09:32.509
You’ll feel much better afterwards!

00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:36.000
Be careful, you shouldn’t do that Trixx.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.551
Do you remember what happened the last time you used your power without a holder?

00:09:38.576 --> 00:09:41.107
Marinette cannot reveal her secret. Mirage!

00:09:51.726 --> 00:09:53.726
How did she-

00:09:55.422 --> 00:09:58.633
Don’t run away like that Marinette! We’re friends, aren’t we?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.691
Follow me !

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.385
Thank you so much Trixx.

00:10:07.842 --> 00:10:09.373
Tikki spots on!

00:10:27.099 --> 00:10:32.253
When a Kwami uses his power without a holder to channel its power, isn't it supposed to cause a disaster?

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:36.568
My power only creates illusions, the possible damage will only be illusory.

00:10:39.632 --> 00:10:44.310
"Gasps" Don't be annoyed… Her Miraculous Ladybug will be fix everything!

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.549
I hope.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:49.466
Oh, Trixx…

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.880
The Eiffel Tower is struck by a strange phenomenon. The authorities recommend …

00:10:56.905 --> 00:10:59.905
I bet you my whole Camembert that it was Trixx who did that

00:11:00.109 --> 00:11:00.400
Trixx ?

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:01.747
The Kwami of illusion.

00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:04.590
This is not an illusion, it's that Ladybug needs some help.

00:11:04.615 --> 00:11:08.701
Well, even if it's not me who do a mistake, I have to help.

00:11:08.813 --> 00:11:10.241
Plagg Claws out!

00:11:12.708 --> 00:11:13.805
Marinette !?

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.880
Has anyone seen Marinette Dupain Cheng?

00:11:29.028 --> 00:11:31.327
In this case, you will help us find her.

00:11:35.022 --> 00:11:38.022
At your Service Princess Fragrance!

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:44.568
She is hidden somewhere.
Let's separate!

00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:47.765
"Screams"

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.179
Well, I think the supervillains are having a party and we haven't been invited.

00:12:01.204 --> 00:12:03.446
They're all searching for Marinette Dupain Cheng, their classmate

00:12:03.471 --> 00:12:06.471
We've already saved her multiple times, didn't we?
Yet everyone seems to like her

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.416
Well seems like she got into an argument with all of her friends at once…

00:12:11.395 --> 00:12:12.975
Hello? You're still there?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.769
I was thinking.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.960
With 5 villains, we're going to have a hard time finding the akumatized object

00:12:18.227 --> 00:12:19.601
You already have an idea, don't you?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.182
I'd like to isolate one of them so that she can tell us where is the akuma,

00:12:23.207 --> 00:12:25.795
but you need to stop Timebreaker from going back in time

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.820
Or else my plan might fail because of her

00:12:28.774 --> 00:12:29.774
Alright, good luck m'lady

00:12:29.902 --> 00:12:31.091
Thanks, you too

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.650
Hey! It's been a long time!

00:12:37.599 --> 00:12:39.357
How is miss stopwatch doing?

00:12:39.382 --> 00:12:40.751
I'm Timebreaker!

00:12:40.776 --> 00:12:43.154
And I've got no time to waste talking to you!

00:12:52.053 --> 00:12:52.499
Ah!

00:12:52.935 --> 00:12:56.186
Too bad for you LadyBug, I'm not the one who has the akuma

00:12:56.249 --> 00:12:58.553
It's no big deal, all I wanted to do was to talk to you

00:12:58.633 --> 00:13:01.083
Let me warn you right away, I won't tell you anything!

00:13:03.247 --> 00:13:05.975
Your friend LadyWifi is having a hard time with LadyBug!

00:13:06.306 --> 00:13:07.306
We'll take care of it!

00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:09.161
What? Don't wanna play cat anymore?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.799
Alya, if I understood well, you're having problems with your best friend?

00:13:14.312 --> 00:13:15.312
Her name is Marinette, right?

00:13:21.494 --> 00:13:24.494
I don't know what happened between the two of you but I'd like to talk to you about a friend of mine

00:13:24.739 --> 00:13:25.931
She's a superhero!

00:13:26.307 --> 00:13:27.411
You know Rena Rouge, right?

00:13:28.837 --> 00:13:32.344
Obviously, we have secrets towards one another, even just because of my secret identity

00:13:32.661 --> 00:13:35.620
But even if we can't tell each other over everything, we trust one another!

00:13:35.792 --> 00:13:38.000
And that's what allows us to fight alongside each other

00:13:40.249 --> 00:13:42.801
You can reject Shadowmoth's power

00:13:46.341 --> 00:13:47.765
Don't listen to her LadyWifi!

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.275
If you do this you won't ever know about your friend's secrets!

00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:51.889
Nor Ladybug's!

00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:55.244
I have absolute trust in you, Alya, I need you!

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:57.092
I need Rena Rouge!

00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:05.721
That’s impossible!

00:14:09.827 --> 00:14:10.598
Wow!

00:14:14.495 --> 00:14:18.244
No one has ever done that before you, you’re incredible!

00:14:18.411 --> 00:14:21.060
Because you’re an incredible friend, Ladybug.

00:14:22.263 --> 00:14:23.000
Pound it.

00:14:24.919 --> 00:14:26.536
Ladybug, the Gang of Secrets is looking for you,

00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:29.677
I’m on the spot but I don’t know if I can hold them back for long.

00:14:30.857 --> 00:14:32.824
Your friend, Lady WiFi betrayed you,

00:14:32.849 --> 00:14:34.722
she preferred Ladybug’s team.

00:14:34.747 --> 00:14:37.604
Hurry up and get it over with him so that you can take care of Ladybug

00:14:40.235 --> 00:14:41.913
Which object is the Akuma in?

00:14:41.938 --> 00:14:45.938
In a bracelet that Timebreaker should have, but you and Chat Noir won’t be able to defeat four villains at the same time.

00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:48.873
I think that it is time to call the mistress of illusions.

00:14:52.698 --> 00:14:53.698
Wow! How did you do that?

00:14:54.953 --> 00:14:58.000
There is something new since I became the Miraculous Guardian.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.940
The Guardian of...?! *gasp*

00:15:00.334 --> 00:15:03.502
But keep the scoop for yourself, especially not a word on the LadyBlog.

00:15:03.973 --> 00:15:05.566
I promise. I know how to keep a secret.

00:15:11.023 --> 00:15:13.023
Trixx, let’s pounce!

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
No Cataclysm to save you now.

00:15:30.828 --> 00:15:31.828
There’s no more time to lose.

00:15:32.817 --> 00:15:33.817
Lucky Charm!

00:15:46.223 --> 00:15:48.009
Okay, I have a plan, listen

00:15:48.138 --> 00:15:51.138
If you dare to touch it, I will activate my power and who knows what might happen to you.

00:15:51.732 --> 00:15:55.665
Why take it from you by force when I can make you my slave and make you give it to me.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.214
It’s time to use your power.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Mirage!

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.953
Cat noir, No!

00:16:06.978 --> 00:16:07.879
Marinette.. catch her!

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:13.716
No! Take her Miraculous first, come back!

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.253
Thank you, my ladies. I was a hair’s breadth away from disaster..

00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:22.628
That’s what friends are made for, my kitty! Okay, you two go fast to the pool.

00:16:22.653 --> 00:16:23.486
What about you?

00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:26.252
I’ll make sure to distract our guests....
Rena Rouge will explain the plan to you.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.985
Catch Ladybug, take her Miraculous!

00:16:42.141 --> 00:16:44.317
Take care of her, I’ll take care of Marinette

00:16:53.156 --> 00:17:00.156
Your turn, princess!

00:17:02.008 --> 00:17:04.418
It’s time to reveal your secrets, Marinette.

00:17:04.443 --> 00:17:07.443
Don’t resist, you will soon do everything we’ll be telling you, Ladybug

00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:10.784
First, give us your miraculous, come on!

00:17:10.809 --> 00:17:11.975
It’s my time

00:17:12.742 --> 00:17:13.742
You can’t escape me!

00:17:20.403 --> 00:17:21.786
Return to reality!

00:17:31.564 --> 00:17:32.564
Cataclysm!

00:17:46.413 --> 00:17:47.413
Thank you, Ladybug

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.651
No more evil doing for you, little Akuma!

00:17:56.312 --> 00:17:57.312
Time to de-evilize!

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Gotcha

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Pound it?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Pound it!

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
You’ve made mistakes in the past, Ladybug, and you will make more

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
One day I’ll end up finding out about your secret.

00:18:32.781 --> 00:18:34.075
Detransformation!

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.302
Thank you, Ladybug

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.779
You know, without your and Cat Noir's help,

00:18:40.804 --> 00:18:42.483
I wouldn't have been able to succeed today.

00:18:42.796 --> 00:18:44.799
I am lucky to have friends like you

00:18:44.893 --> 00:18:46.869
So, thank you.

00:18:51.905 --> 00:18:54.900
It's true, my breakup with Luka broke my heart,

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:58.656
and not being able to tell how I feel to Adrien,
it also made me feel bad.

00:18:59.126 --> 00:19:00.688
Love is so difficult...

00:19:01.496 --> 00:19:03.950
I think I’ll stay on the friendship!

00:19:03.975 --> 00:19:05.975
It’s already complicated enough to keep my friends!

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.745
Rose: Take your time!
Mylène: Everything will eventually work out!

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.158
And whatever happens, we will
always be here for you Marinette!

00:19:12.183 --> 00:19:15.000
When you will feel ready, warn us and
we will find a new awesome plan

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.510
to tell to Adrien, Luka or whoever that you love them!

00:19:21.025 --> 00:19:23.247
Girls, you are the ones I love!

00:19:25.023 --> 00:19:26.669
Alix: Goodbye, Marinette!
Rose: See you tomorrow!

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
I’ll join you later, I have one last
thing to say to Marinette.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.693
In fact you didn’t tell us everything.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
A reporter and a best friend
feel this kind of things!

00:19:43.406 --> 00:19:46.406
I’m not going to investigate on you
or force you to tell me that, you know!

00:19:46.431 --> 00:19:48.431
If you don’t want to tell me what’s
happening it is your right.

00:19:50.031 --> 00:19:51.113
Will we always be friends?

00:19:53.203 --> 00:19:56.738
Marinette, I’m your best friend,
and I will always be.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.884
That’s why it hurts me to not be
able to help you to be less alone!

00:20:06.765 --> 00:20:08.926
Alya wait, stay!

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
You're right I'm very lonely

00:20:12.025 --> 00:20:13.069
More alone than ever before

00:20:13.094 --> 00:20:14.544
And I find it harder and harder to resist

00:20:14.569 --> 00:20:16.469
Do you know why I broke up with Luka?

00:20:16.494 --> 00:20:18.344
Not because I don't like him, he's amazing

00:20:18.394 --> 00:20:20.714
It's because there's something I can't tell to him

00:20:20.739 --> 00:20:22.584
Do you know why I'm drawing a line on Adrien?

00:20:22.609 --> 00:20:24.459
Because it will be the same with him.

00:20:24.484 --> 00:20:27.341
You're right, I have secrets and I lie all the time

00:20:27.366 --> 00:20:28.894
I lie to my friends, to my parents...

00:20:28.919 --> 00:20:29.693
To everyone..

00:20:29.718 --> 00:20:32.175
And the worst part about it is that I can't do anything about it

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.790
We always have the choice Marinette

00:20:33.815 --> 00:20:35.361
No, at least not for me

00:20:35.781 --> 00:20:37.368
I’ve got no other choice

00:20:37.393 --> 00:20:40.024
It's all beyond us Alya, it's too heavy to carry

00:20:40.277 --> 00:20:42.707
If it's too heavy, we’ll be two to carry it

00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:45.441
If I tell you, things between us will never be the same

00:20:45.466 --> 00:20:47.466
It's going to destroy everything, change it all.

00:20:48.026 --> 00:20:50.100
Marinette, whatever you’ll say, I'm your friend!

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.558
And me…

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:54.240
I am Ladybug...

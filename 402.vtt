"no msgs but do not forget my cheese"

i28
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.812 line:97%
CatNoir: What could she be doing?!

i29
00:02:13.837 --> 00:02:15.437 line:97%
"Ladybug here, leave a msg"

i30
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.380 line:97%
Maybe now that you're the miraculous guardian, you've more important things to do..

i31
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.100 line:97%
but you know it's okay, I'm the cat for the job!

i32
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.180 line:97%
I'm starting without you, see you soon I hope, let me know.

i33
00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:35.795 line:97%
Kids: What? It's ChatNoir! ChatNoir! ChatNoir!

i34
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.460 line:97%
CatNoir: I'll finally be able to stretch my legs!

i35
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.460 line:97%
Kids: ChatNoir!

i36
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.900 line:97%
Thank you so much!

i37
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.340 line:97%
CatNoir: In your service

i38
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.180 line:97%
"no msgs but do not forget my cheese"

i39
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.376 line:97%
*whistling*

i40
00:02:53.314 --> 00:02:58.000 line:97%
So Mister Banana tell me, you have punch,
the peach, the banana, you understand?

i41
00:02:58.628 --> 00:02:59.705 line:97%
Don’t worry, forget it.

i42
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.713 line:97%
Oh Mister Ramier, it's been a while that you haven’t been akumatised.

i43
00:03:02.738 --> 00:03:08.296 line:97%
You don't miss it a bit, being Mr. Pigeon? Don’t you feel a bit sad, desperate,
 angry, annoyed maybe?

i44
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.294 line:97%
Even a little disturbed?

i45
00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:13.975 line:97%
Thank you for worrying about it Cat Noir
but I’m in an excellent mood lately!

i46
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.390 line:97%
Oh, so I’ll go.

i47
00:03:16.368 --> 00:03:18.975 line:97%
Say hello to dear Ladybug from me!

i48
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000 line:97%
Of course... If I see her one day.

i49
00:03:21.903 --> 00:03:24.903 line:97%
No messages but don’t forget my cheese.

i50
00:03:25.933 --> 00:03:27.933 line:97%
A glass of milk as usual mister Cat Noir?

i51
00:03:28.423 --> 00:03:28.893 line:97%
mhm!

i52
00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:32.975 line:97%
How is dear Ladybug, she isn't making much
of an appearance at the moment…

i53
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000 line:97%
Yeah,  it's particularly calm these days.

i54
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.604 line:97%
This bag was my life Sabrina and you find the way to lose it!

i55
00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.331 line:97%
It’s no longer worth talking to me. Understand?

i56
00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:43.975 line:97%
But- Chloé-

i57
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.646 line:97%
Shhh, you shut  up now.

i58
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:47.624 line:97%
But- Shut- and-  Shut! Shut! Shut!

i59
00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:49.134 line:97%
Not a word. And I forbid you to look at me.

i60
00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.994 line:97%
HIDE YOUR EYES.

i61
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.929 line:97%
(Gasp) huh-

i62
00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:52.921 line:97%
It smells like akumatisation!

i63
00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.279 line:97%
Oh- Oh- my bag!

i64
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.975 line:97%
What an idiot! You couldn’t say that it was here!?

i65
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.975 line:97%
But I was not allowed to speak, Chloe...

i66
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000 line:97%
And it’s always the case! But- Shut!

i67
00:04:04.983 --> 00:04:05.900 line:97%
Oh-oh!

i68
00:04:07.544 --> 00:04:09.544 line:97%
On second thought, I will take a double milk.

i69
00:04:14.776 --> 00:04:18.393 line:97%
No messages but don’t forget my chee-
Here's ladybug! Leave a message!

i70
00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:22.975 line:97%
Hello again, bugaboo.
Do you know who this is? It’s the one you stood up- huh?

i71
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000 line:97%
YES! To never weaken, mother!

i72
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.752 line:97%
I learned the lesson well!

i73
00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.260 line:97%
And never let-

i74
00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:29.395 line:97%
yourself be surprised.

i75
00:04:29.812 --> 00:04:32.975 line:97%
Apply these principles to fencing if you want to be better than Adrien Agreste!

i76
00:04:33.107 --> 00:04:37.948 line:97%
Adrien? Don’t worry mother.
I have everything I need to succeed!

i77
00:04:39.202 --> 00:04:40.202 line:97%
End of the patrol bugaboo!

i78
00:04:43.478 --> 00:04:44.083 line:97%
Claws out.

i79
00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:58.011 line:97%
On you forget it exists so much else,
and it’s a new variety, it might be a good surprise!

i80
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.151 line:97%
Miss Kagami Tsurugi called to signal that your
fencing class’s schedule changed again.

i81
00:05:05.176 --> 00:05:06.261 line:97%
It will be an hour early.

i82
00:05:06.484 --> 00:05:08.323 line:97%
Ah, thank you, Nathalie

i83
00:05:09.038 --> 00:05:10.671 line:97%
What are you hiding again, Kagami?

i84
00:05:11.882 --> 00:05:17.366 line:97%
Those schedule changes imposed by the Agrestes are exhausting!
 But make the most of it to do one extra hour of Russian!

i85
00:05:17.475 --> 00:05:17.876 line:97%
Yes mother

i86
00:05:18.247 --> 00:05:20.977 line:97%
Those schedule changes imposed by the Tsurugis are exhausting!

i87
00:05:21.002 --> 00:05:24.935 line:97%
Once you're home, don’t forget to try the
outfit that I’ve just finished for your next photoshoot

i88
00:05:25.038 --> 00:05:25.651 line:97%
Of course, father

i89
00:05:30.488 --> 00:05:35.975 line:97%
Hmmm? Kagami?? Adrien?? Your fencing class starts in 1 hour and 
Mr. D’Argencourt is not here yet!

i90
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.975 line:97%
OH! Really? And here I was sure of noting the right schedule this time!

i91
00:05:40.192 --> 00:05:41.501 line:97%
I’m sorry but you can’t-

i92
00:05:41.526 --> 00:05:43.380 line:97%
Stay here alone in school!

i93
00:05:43.432 --> 00:05:46.436 line:97%
No problem M. Aprel. We’ll come back in 1 hour.

i94
00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:48.505 line:97%
But what are you going to do, Kagami?

i95
00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:52.930 line:97%
The art room?

i96
00:05:53.555 --> 00:05:54.909 line:97%
But why did you bring me here?

i97
00:05:55.338 --> 00:05:57.062 line:97%
I never told anyone.

i98
00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:58.845 line:97%
But, I’m passionate about drawing.

i99
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.465 line:97%
And I always have been

i100
00:06:01.835 --> 00:06:06.465 line:97%
Art never lies, poses people do always reflect their personalities

i101
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000 line:97%
But my mom doesn't let me draw, she thinks I'm not good enough…

i102
00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:12.734 line:97%
You are incredibly talented Kagami!

i103
00:06:13.225 --> 00:06:14.225 line:97%
Really? You think so?

i104
00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:14.799 line:97%
Mhm!

i105
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000 line:97%
Make a pose for me, I would like to draw you

i106
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.390 line:97%
What pose do you want me to make?

i107
00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:20.819 line:97%
A pose that you feel comfortable with

i108
00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.996 line:97%
You know, I admire alot Toulause Lautreck,

i109
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:26.324 line:97%
I would like to draw you just like the characters he used to paint

i110
00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:30.012 line:97%
Did you know that sometimes he used to sign his drawings with an ideogram?
In Japanese?

i111
00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:32.601 line:97%
Ugh, I'm redoing it, this is not you.

i112
00:06:33.508 --> 00:06:34.508 line:97%
Can I see it?

i113
00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:35.323 line:97%
Make another pose.

i114
00:06:35.774 --> 00:06:41.040 line:97%
 It's easy to make a beautiful art of you since you're beautiful, 
but I wanna draw the real you, what you are in the inside.

i115
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.460 line:97%
No… Still not you. Change your pose

i116
00:06:46.913 --> 00:06:51.305 line:97%
These are model poses, try something more natural, more like you!

i117
00:06:51.938 --> 00:06:53.798 line:97%
Hmm… What do you think of CAT!

i118
00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:58.389 line:97%
Uhh no.. uhmm… I mean, do you prefer… this pose??

i119
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.492 line:97%
No, this is absolutely not natural.

i120
00:07:00.517 --> 00:07:02.959 line:97%
Yes it is, I promise, this is really me!

i121
00:07:03.086 --> 00:07:05.367 line:97%
NO! This is you when you're acting like a clown!

i122
00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:08.002 line:97%
But maybe when I act like a clown… it’s really me..

i123
00:07:14.683 --> 00:07:17.249 line:97%
That way, that’s who you really are.

i124
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:19.231 line:97%
But.. are you sure?

i125
00:07:19.436 --> 00:07:21.858 line:97%
Yes, you are.. Perfect.

i126
00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:29.228 line:97%
Seems like it’s really time for fencing lessons now.

i127
00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:37.197 line:97%
Ready?

i128
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.553 line:97%
Set!

i129
00:07:39.457 --> 00:07:40.535 line:97%
Go!

i130
00:07:47.555 --> 00:07:48.147 line:97%
Touché

i131
00:07:48.626 --> 00:07:49.473 line:97%
En garde..

i132
00:07:54.663 --> 00:07:57.481 line:97%
Uh, sorry I forgot something in the locker room

i133
00:08:08.366 --> 00:08:09.511 line:97%
It’s time for our patrol!

i134
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:10.975 line:97%
You didn't forget right?

i135
00:08:11.269 --> 00:08:11.790 line:97%
BOO!

i136
00:08:13.077 --> 00:08:14.077 line:97%
Cat Noir?

i137
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.700 line:97%
(AAHHHH) I talked to him, and oh?

i138
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000 line:97%
Won’t you stop with your stupid jokes, I could have hurt you!

i139
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.611 line:97%
M’lady, the only thing that hurts...

i140
00:08:25.636 --> 00:08:27.720 line:97%
It's the fact of you leaving me on patrol alone...

i141
00:08:27.868 --> 00:08:30.168 line:97%
I even missed your angry little looks.

i142
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:33.646 line:97%
I'm a sorry kitten. I'm very busy nowadays...

i143
00:08:33.671 --> 00:08:38.000 line:97%
You amaze me, guardian of the miraculous,
with great title comes great responsibilities!

i144
00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:40.025 line:97%
I promise I won't forget our patrols anymore.

i145
00:08:49.933 --> 00:08:50.745 line:97%
Kagami !

i146
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.942 line:97%
I have to go home my father must be worried...

i147
00:09:06.202 --> 00:09:07.202 line:97%
See you tomorrow !

i148
00:09:10.084 --> 00:09:11.433 line:97%
Oh, see you tomorrow everyone !

i149
00:09:22.443 --> 00:09:25.075 line:97%
I forgot something in class, I'll call you later!

i150
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.760 line:97%
Tatsu, go.

i151
00:09:34.232 --> 00:09:35.232 line:97%
Great! Yeah!

i152
00:09:36.448 --> 00:09:38.975 line:97%
Ah, and I filmed it all dude, this concert was just great!

i153
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.184 line:97%
Not really Nino, I completely missed the intro..

i154
00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:43.209 line:97%
No problem, we can do it again, Adrien..

i155
00:09:43.234 --> 00:09:45.000 line:97%
Yes! We're going to play the song again!

i156
00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:46.244 line:97%
Adrien, it's time..

i157
00:09:46.971 --> 00:09:48.446 line:97%
Five little minutes?

i158
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.808 line:97%
Well, I’ll do better next time, promise

i159
00:09:51.867 --> 00:09:52.595 line:97%
See you tommorow guys!

i160
00:10:10.078 --> 00:10:11.078 line:97%
Weird, The cars are not here yet

i161
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.106 line:97%
It’s a shame, we could have replayed the song

i162
00:10:14.975 --> 00:10:16.975 line:97%
But at least that gives us a little more time together

i163
00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:20.000 line:97%
Don’t worry, we’ll have enough time together especially that we’re going to Prince Ali’s birthday together

i164
00:10:20.444 --> 00:10:22.444 line:97%
I meant only us two

i165
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.662 line:97%
You know, I’m so happy with you.

i166
00:10:25.694 --> 00:10:27.834 line:97%
I think that we’re very similar

i167
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000 line:97%
Do you feel the same way? Do you also...

i168
00:10:34.249 --> 00:10:36.249 line:97%
Uh.. sorry I thought that there was a wasp

i169
00:10:37.148 --> 00:10:38.904 line:97%
Do you love me, as well?

i170
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000 line:97%
You were saying?

i171
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.540 line:97%
Adrien... What’s the matter?

i172
00:10:42.664 --> 00:10:45.664 line:97%
I’ve lost something on the boat when my bag fell, don’t wait for me

i173
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.140 line:97%
See you at the birthday party!

i174
00:10:51.968 --> 00:10:52.968 line:97%
Tatsu, Take me to the town hall

i175
00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:03.223 line:97%
I still hope we’ll be going to the prince’s birthday, it’s always a big ceremony 
where they get the best cheese

i176
00:11:03.248 --> 00:11:05.000 line:97%
For now Ladybug needs me

i177
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.250 line:97%
PLAGG, CLAWS OUT!

i178
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.065 line:97%
Cat Noir, HawkMoth merged his powers with those of the peacock to become ShadowMoth.

i179
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.850 line:97%
He created a supervillain and a sentimonster at the same time. Come quickly!

i180
00:11:16.663 --> 00:11:21.663 line:97%
You will now have to tell the truth to all questions you’ll be asked. I’ll start, who are you, Ladybug?

i181
00:11:22.383 --> 00:11:23.383 line:97%
I.. Am-

i182
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000 line:97%
A very good swimmer!

i183
00:11:31.412 --> 00:11:36.000 line:97%
Dear Prince Ali, in the name of the city of Paris and its inhabitants,
 I wish you a happy birthday.

i184
00:11:38.078 --> 00:11:41.390 line:97%
Didn’t I agree with Gabriel Agreste that you would come with his son?

i185
00:11:41.421 --> 00:11:45.533 line:97%
Oh uh... He’s here, mother, he’s answering questions from journalists, I’ll be back.

i186
00:11:56.929 --> 00:11:59.255 line:97%
Ahh, M’lady, it’s been a long time since I had so much fun

i187
00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:02.697 line:97%
Haha, if fighting against a villain with three eyes and a giant Monster 
amuses you...

i188
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:06.368 line:97%
at this point, I can’t dare to imagine what your daily life looks like

i189
00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:10.829 line:97%
A supervillain, a giant, and Shadowmoth!
Don’t you find this new name more amusing?

i190
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000 line:97%
He can change his name as much as he wants, we’ll catch him eventually!

i191
00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.734 line:97%
You can count on me and my jokes, Buginette

i192
00:12:17.235 --> 00:12:19.705 line:97%
You won’t have to do it for much longer

i193
00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:23.913 line:97%
In truth, I only have so much fun with you, bye Buginette!

i194
00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:27.593 line:97%
Claws in!

i195
00:12:32.709 --> 00:12:35.450 line:97%
Kagami! I didn’t make you wait too long, I hope

i196
00:12:36.249 --> 00:12:39.928 line:97%
And I hope you found what you are looking for. Huuh- On the barge!

i197
00:12:39.953 --> 00:12:42.896 line:97%
On the barge... of course, yes yes I found it! Thank you.

i198
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:52.000 line:97%
What was it? Ohh it’s this little lucky charm that Marinette gave it to me for 
uhh- no I lost it, again!

i199
00:12:52.669 --> 00:12:54.760 line:97%
Are you talking about this?

i200
00:12:55.916 --> 00:13:00.525 line:97%
Listen, I lied too, I lied to my mother so that we could see each other,

i201
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.775 line:97%
I even lied to her that you came with me tonight,

i202
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.594 line:97%
I lied during every fencing class so I can spend more time with you!

i203
00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:13.187 line:97%
Do you see? We are both liars, the difference is that I lie just to be with you.

i204
00:13:13.212 --> 00:13:15.890 line:97%
You! You lie to not be with me

i205
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.500 line:97%
Kagami!

i206
00:13:21.374 --> 00:13:23.421 line:97%
I’d rather be alone.

i207
00:13:28.795 --> 00:13:35.694 line:97%
It only takes one lie to ruin the confidence!
And what if in the end all is lies in our world?

i208
00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:42.000 line:97%
Fly away my little akuma, and blackened this unhappy heart

i209
00:13:53.793 --> 00:13:54.573 line:97%
Lies!

i210
00:13:55.210 --> 00:14:00.410 line:97%
I’m Shadow Moth, I give you the power to rid the world of liars

i211
00:14:00.435 --> 00:14:04.099 line:97%
In return, you must give me the Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

i212
00:14:04.124 --> 00:14:05.609 line:97%
Do you give me your word?

i213
00:14:06.102 --> 00:14:10.102 line:97%
You can trust me. No lie will be tolerated, Shadow Moth!

i214
00:14:14.696 --> 00:14:14.789 line:97%
Oh!

i215
00:14:17.258 --> 00:14:17.930 line:97%
Nooo…

i216
00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.191 line:97%
This is all my fault… I have to save Kagami!

i217
00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:25.364 line:97%
Plagg Claws out!

i218
00:14:42.291 --> 00:14:49.181 line:97%
Oh, Prince Ali, one more year is to be celebrated but you are still Rock and Roll in your head!

i219
00:14:49.206 --> 00:14:50.193 line:97%
"Applause and Roar"

i220
00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:55.205 line:97%
In the name of the law, what is that!

i221
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.826 line:97%
I'm Lies!

i222
00:14:56.851 --> 00:14:58.774 line:97%
have you ever lied to Officer Roger?

i223
00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:01.756 line:97%
Of course not! A policeman never lies.

i224
00:15:01.781 --> 00:15:02.781 line:97%
You lie, officer Roger!

i225
00:15:03.331 --> 00:15:04.331 line:97%
Aaaah

i226
00:15:08.715 --> 00:15:11.063 line:97%
And you Mother? Have you ever lied?

i227
00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:11.975 line:97%
Kagami!

i228
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000 line:97%
I don't permit you!

i229
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.556 line:97%
"Aaaaah"

i230
00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.301 line:97%
"Gasps"

i231
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.060 line:97%
Kaga… Lie stop this now !

i232
00:15:27.225 --> 00:15:31.573 line:97%
Oh but here is a new candidate for the lie detector test.

i233
00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:34.000 line:97%
I am not lying to you when I tell you that I will free you from Shadow Moth!

i234
00:15:34.025 --> 00:15:35.025 line:97%
Me I will help him, yeah!

i235
00:15:36.606 --> 00:15:37.711 line:97%
Don't stay here Jagged.

i236
00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:41.800 line:97%
I fear nothing, I'm an artist. I still hold to my fans.

i237
00:15:41.825 --> 00:15:43.825 line:97%
It's wrong, you lie to them about your age!

i238
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000 line:97%
Oh, that's not Rock and Roll! You're...

i239
00:15:46.992 --> 00:15:50.518 line:97%
A world without lies would no longer need superheroes at Noir.

i240
00:15:56.098 --> 00:15:56.398 line:97%
Catacly…

i241
00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:58.343 line:97%
No, If you touch the sphere you will be paralyzed.

i242
00:15:58.368 --> 00:15:59.956 line:97%
Unless you've never lied.

i243
00:15:59.981 --> 00:16:01.039 line:97%
Yes, but is it the case?

i244
00:16:01.064 --> 00:16:02.064 line:97%
Uh not really...

i245
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.590 line:97%
What about you?

i246
00:16:04.648 --> 00:16:08.610 line:97%
Of course not kitty!
We have to lie, even just to keep our identities a secret!

i247
00:16:08.656 --> 00:16:12.420 line:97%
And if we touch this sphere, nothing will be able to stop it from annihilating Paris!

i248
00:16:12.685 --> 00:16:13.975 line:97%
Okay, but what do we do then?

i249
00:16:14.669 --> 00:16:16.004 line:97%
Lucky Charm!

i250
00:16:23.726 --> 00:16:25.802 line:97%
I can't wait to know what you're going to do with a drone

i251
00:16:25.877 --> 00:16:29.975 line:97%
Okay, we can't go inside. This device has never lied before, which means...

i252
00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.730 line:97%
Make diversion whilst I send our flying spy!

i253
00:16:34.382 --> 00:16:35.382 line:97%
Let's keep in contact

i254
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.652 line:97%
Your wish is my command m'lady. If I lie I'll go to hell ~

i255
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.251 line:97%
Youhouuu my name's not Chat Noir!
I am not a superhero!

i256
00:16:43.276 --> 00:16:45.133 line:97%
I hate Ladybug!

i257
00:16:45.158 --> 00:16:49.839 line:97%
And I think that ShadowMoth could've called himself PanFly! It's funnier!

i258
00:16:49.864 --> 00:16:54.337 line:97%
Oh yes, I was about to forget: my favorite dish is cabbage with white sauce!
Yummy!

i259
00:16:54.827 --> 00:16:57.827 line:97%
Catch that lying cat, and grab his miraculous!

i260
00:16:58.312 --> 00:17:03.000 line:97%
I won't go back on my words ShadowMoth,
liars always end up paying for their mistakes!

i261
00:17:08.408 --> 00:17:09.975 line:97%
I know what the akumatized object is

i262
00:17:10.234 --> 00:17:11.203 line:97%
Amazing! Break it then!

i263
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.628 line:97%
I don't how to do it without touching it

i264
00:17:13.775 --> 00:17:18.497 line:97%
You're right, only someone who's never lied could infiltrate the sphere to do it, 
but such a person doesn't exist!

i265
00:17:23.006 --> 00:17:27.155 line:97%
Of course, it exists Chat Noir, it really does!! Fang, Jagged Stone's crocodile!

i266
00:17:27.355 --> 00:17:29.482 line:97%
It's an animal, it doesn't know how to lie!

i267
00:17:29.842 --> 00:17:30.842 line:97%
Great thinking!

i268
00:17:43.231 --> 00:17:44.516 line:97%
Yes! It's working!

i269
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.958 line:97%
Civilians : Heeeelp!

i270
00:18:01.986 --> 00:18:04.000 line:97%
If Lies sees it coming, we’re screwed.

i271
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.839 line:97%
There are only two more liars left in Paris, and one of them knows how to turn 
his attention.

i272
00:18:08.864 --> 00:18:10.987 line:97%
No, wait doesn’t do that, and what if I’m mistaken?

i273
00:18:11.495 --> 00:18:14.000 line:97%
You know what? I trust you.

i274
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.040 line:97%
Cat Noir no! Don’t do that! You’re crazy!

i275
00:18:16.065 --> 00:18:17.065 line:97%
Yes, crazy for you M’lady.

i276
00:18:19.834 --> 00:18:22.834 line:97%
No, you’re just crazy unconscious.

i277
00:18:25.912 --> 00:18:30.163 line:97%
It is the moment of truth. Take Cat Noir’s Miraculous and then it will be Ladybug’s turn.

i278
00:18:32.872 --> 00:18:33.872 line:97%
Hurry up!

i279
00:18:58.391 --> 00:19:00.391 line:97%
No!

i280
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:03.298 line:97%
No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

i281
00:19:06.716 --> 00:19:08.181 line:97%
Time to de-evilize.

i282
00:19:12.498 --> 00:19:13.084 line:97%
Gotcha!

i283
00:19:14.116 --> 00:19:16.116 line:97%
Bye-bye, little butterfly.

i284
00:19:16.648 --> 00:19:17.648 line:97%
Miraculous Ladybug!

i285
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.426 line:97%
Seriously you need to stop doing this to me!

i286
00:19:32.451 --> 00:19:36.801 line:97%
Yes, but it’s because I find that angry look of yours absolutely irresistible.

i287
00:19:37.406 --> 00:19:38.406 line:97%
Pound it!

i288
00:19:40.264 --> 00:19:41.264 line:97%
Plagg, claws in.

i289
00:19:43.203 --> 00:19:45.066 line:97%
Ah, Ladybug.

i290
00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:53.659 line:97%
Oh how romantic that is, I mean I understand you even though I love every 
cheese, I always come back to my favorite, camembert.

i291
00:19:57.081 --> 00:20:00.971 line:97%
On guard. Ready. Go

i292
00:20:08.828 --> 00:20:09.828 line:97%
Ouch hey!

i293
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000 line:97%
Is enough!

i294
00:20:12.306 --> 00:20:14.650 line:97%
It's a fencing lesson here, not a personal problem-solving.

i295
00:20:15.187 --> 00:20:16.187 line:97%
Cease it!

i296
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.975 line:97%
I'm sorry for hurting you Kagami.

i297
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000 line:97%
And you know all the good times we shared

i298
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000 line:97%
It was not lies

i299
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000 line:97%
I know

i300
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000 line:97%
I know you are hiding something

i301
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000 line:97%
But I also know there is sincerity in you

i302
00:20:32.062 --> 00:20:34.062 line:97%
So we can't be friends?

i303
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.280 line:97%
How can you trust someone who lied to you?

i304
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:43.171 line:97%
When I'm ready to see you again, I'll let you know.

i305
00:20:51.517 --> 00:20:54.000 line:97%
Do you know what the difference is, between us and the rest of the world M’Lady?

i306
00:20:54.342 --> 00:20:56.000 line:97%
We can't be completely honest with each other

i307
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000 line:97%
We have our secrets and sometimes we have to lie

i308
00:21:00.845 --> 00:21:02.845 line:97%
But we know we can trust each other

00:00:03.612 --> 00:00:05.800
In the day time I’m Marinette

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:08.579
Just a normal girl with a normal life

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.196
But there’s something about me that no one knows yet

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:13.800
Cause I have a secret

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.800
Miraculous!

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.800
Simply the best!

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.800
Up to the test when things go wrong!

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.800
Miraculous, the luckiest!

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.036
The power of love, always so strong!

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:29.251
Miraculous!

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:30.276
Miraculous!

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.800
[Kwamis arguing]

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.800
Let us go with you.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.800
This isn't fair.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:37.909
Please!

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:40.643
[sigh] You know why you can't go.

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:44.313
When he made me the guardian, his memory was erased by magic.

00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:46.330
Now, master Fu is like everyone else.

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:50.355
He can’t know about the Miraculous, my secret identity, or you Kwamis.

00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:51.917
Come Tikki, let's go.

00:00:52.143 --> 00:00:54.064
[Kwamis arguing with Marinette]

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.542
Why can Tikki go, and we can't?

00:00:56.573 --> 00:00:59.311
I’m sorry, but you Know I have to be with Marinette,

00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:00.800
she may need to transform.

00:01:00.907 --> 00:01:03.915
What if we also hide? Then he will not see us.

00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:05.688
That would be okay, right?

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.641
We just want to see if he’s okay.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.912
He took care of us for over 100 years.

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:13.943
I know but you have to let him live his new life with his soul mate,

00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:15.800
Now it’s my turn to take care of you.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.465
Marinette, but you know that master Fu trusted me to help him to protect the Miracle box.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.800
I was more than just a Kwami to him,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.800
I was his friend.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.800
And I miss him so much.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800
I understand, but…

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.800
All right, you can come with me, Wayyz.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.800
[Kwamis arguing with Marinette]

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.800
I can’t believe this!

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.800
Come on!

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.800
I can’t take you all at once.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.800
Why? Please!

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.800
because… uh…

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.800
It’s because the Miracle box needs to be protected

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.800
So you’re saying that if one of us stays here protecting the box,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.800
the rest can go, right?

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.359
what? Of course not!

00:01:55.392 --> 00:01:57.336
[Kwamis arguing with Marinette]

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:58.800
but how do we decide who stays?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800
Fate will decide.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.477
let’s do a Kwami-Qua-Who

00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:04.558
kwami what?

00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:08.808
Kwami-Qua-Who! The chosen one is you!

It’s decided, Marinette stays!

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.421
Stop! Wait a minute, that’s not fair

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:17.905
besides, I’m the guardian, I make the decisions and that’s final

00:02:18.225 --> 00:02:20.326

She’s right, what if someone gets akumatized or a sentimonster appears?

00:02:40.114 --> 00:02:41.443
I have a bad feeling that something is going to go wrong.

00:02:41.468 --> 00:02:42.982
You go and i’ll stay here guarding the box

00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:44.938
Enguard, my lord!

00:02:45.323 --> 00:02:46.323
Thank you, Barkk

Okay, everyone inside!

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:52.739
But everyone has to be silent!
I don't want to hear a peep out of you.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.357
That isn't being silent

Oh god! We’re still not out of danger, my lord.

00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:09.331
Ready?

We’re gonna see Master Fu!

Oh! My phone is ringing on it’s own again

If it doesn't stop I swear it’s going to end up in the trash.

Hi Marianne

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.800
Hello Marinette. Do you remember her my love?

00:03:45.034 --> 00:03:47.897
She’s the one who found you after your accident on the boat,

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:49.733
The boat that erased your memory

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.679
Huh.

Yes, my life in London has been wonderful.

00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:11.250
Would you believe that Wang has discovered a passion of painting?

00:04:11.274 --> 00:04:13.669
Actually, to thank you for helping me,

00:04:13.694 --> 00:04:15.991

Yes

00:04:22.844 --> 00:04:25.662
But even I don't know what it represents...

00:04:25.687 --> 00:04:29.067
But when I think of you, that's  what I see!

00:04:29.098 --> 00:04:29.692
So it's yours!

00:04:32.557 --> 00:04:37.283

"He touch me, he touched me!"

00:04:51.201 --> 00:04:53.680
So what are you going to do here during your visit in Paris?

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.417
Paint, of course!

00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:57.630
Montmartre, the Tuileries Garden,

00:04:57.673 --> 00:05:01.469
the boards of the Seine, is there a better place to paint?

00:05:02.484 --> 00:05:03.914
I'll start :) Don't mind me.

00:05:05.414 --> 00:05:07.070
Do you want more cake?

00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:07.797
Of course!

00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:13.680
He seemed strong as a tiger!

00:05:13.705 --> 00:05:15.205
What an original painting!

00:05:15.362 --> 00:05:16.995
Is there any cake left?

00:05:22.673 --> 00:05:24.853
I told you I had a bad feeling.

00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:28.067
How are you in possession of the Mother-Box, young lady?

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.505
Who are you?

00:05:31.692 --> 00:05:35.591
This is the Grand Master Su Han, the Celestial Guardian of the Miracle Box.

00:05:35.624 --> 00:05:37.630
But I am the guardian of the box.

00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:42.415
The Celestial Guardian was it's guardian before the incident caused by Master Fu.

00:05:42.462 --> 00:05:43.946
How did you find me?

00:05:43.971 --> 00:05:47.807
Guardians' staffs are equipped with compasses that are capable of finding miracle boxes at any given time!

00:05:47.832 --> 00:05:50.168
That's not fair, why don't I have a staff?

00:05:50.488 --> 00:05:53.141
Precisely, because you are not the real guardian

00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:56.313
This is all a misunderstanding and the incorrect shape of the box proves it.

00:05:56.338 --> 00:05:59.321
But I don’t understand, Master Fu handed her over to me

00:05:59.415 --> 00:06:02.617
Fu?! Wang Fu? We knew him as crybaby

00:06:02.642 --> 00:06:07.552
The incompetent desciple who was unable to fast for
3 days and do a thousand finger pushups?

00:06:07.577 --> 00:06:12.513
Fu should never have become a guardian.
He never was up to our expectations.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:17.394
Master Fu made mistakes when he was young,
but despite that he still protected the box for years!

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:23.524
He even sacrificed himself and wiped his memory to save us,
and now he is an amazing painter!

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:26.297
That old man was crybaby?

00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:27.485
Wait...

00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:31.796
A few Kwamis are missing!

00:06:31.906 --> 00:06:38.164
When I got the box, Master Fu already had lost Nooroo, Duusu and the butterfly and peacock Miraculouses.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:42.888
He also lost a few Miraculous?
He's way more incompetent than I thought!

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.928
Plagg!

00:06:44.075 --> 00:06:45.918
Young lady, where is Plagg?

00:06:46.262 --> 00:06:48.551
That I do know!
He's with Cat Noir!

00:06:48.668 --> 00:06:50.157
And who is Cat Noir?

00:06:50.536 --> 00:06:52.063
Well...
I don't know \_(-_-)_/

00:06:52.088 --> 00:06:53.979
We shouldn't really know each other's identity...

00:06:58.078 --> 00:06:59.663
So this is the modern world

00:06:59.688 --> 00:07:02.093
"Protected" by reckless fools.

00:07:02.372 --> 00:07:04.432
Guardians aren't allowed to wear Miraculous!

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:07.510
A few are missing, Plagg is roaming free...

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:09.837
That's what caused the extinction of dinosaurs and dragons.

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.595
Isn't anyone unsettled by this?

00:07:12.376 --> 00:07:14.367
That's it. Come on Kwamis...

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:15.884
Back in the box!

00:07:19.903 --> 00:07:21.496
What are you doing?

00:07:22.772 --> 00:07:26.006
I will remind you of a few of the perfect rules you have violated.

00:07:26.287 --> 00:07:29.646
Rule 14: Kwamis must not live outside of their box.

00:07:29.904 --> 00:07:33.170
Rule 52: Guardians must NEVER lose a Miraculous

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:39.497
Rule 133: Guardians must NEVER under ANY circumstances
wear a Miraculous.

00:07:40.307 --> 00:07:41.994
But Master Fu wore one himself!

00:07:42.181 --> 00:07:45.789
Precisely... This proves my point from the start.

00:07:45.814 --> 00:07:48.142
Neither you or Fu are capable of being a guardian!

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:52.352
You don't have any respect for rules and order!

00:07:52.377 --> 00:07:55.579
Not to mention that Kwamis should not be owned by a child.

00:07:55.604 --> 00:07:57.782
They are extremely powerful cosmic creatures!

00:07:58.417 --> 00:08:02.555
It's important to be in control of them, and you evidently can't.

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:03.761
En garde, my lord.

00:08:04.502 --> 00:08:07.915
Challenging me like this is like pulling a tiger's whiskers, villain!

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.252
Calm down Master, calm down. It's just a movie, see?

00:08:12.572 --> 00:08:14.221
What a powerful spell

00:08:14.423 --> 00:08:17.416
How did that warrior end up in this thin prison of glass and metal?

00:08:17.565 --> 00:08:19.800
Anyway, I can't lose any more time

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.956
Take me to Chat Noir, young lady.

00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:23.566
Do you think that's a good idea?

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:27.800
I don't know, although, he's the celestial guardian

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.800
You're right.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.620
Tikki, spots on!

00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:52.228
What are you doing with your weapon?

00:08:52.627 --> 00:08:54.848
This is my bugphone, to contact  Chat Noir

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:58.321
Do you no longer need carriers pigeons to communicate?

00:08:58.807 --> 00:09:00.807
We're still not out of danger, my lord.

00:09:07.719 --> 00:09:08.890
Hi, My Lady.

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:11.775
Is this the wonderful guest that you mentioned?

00:09:12.111 --> 00:09:14.649
Of course, another child.

00:09:14.674 --> 00:09:15.800
Chat Noir, this is...

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.800
I am Grand-Master Su-Han, the Celestial Guardian of the mother box

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.800
Wait a second... Aren't you the guardian, My Lady?

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.800
When the lion speaks, the cubs listen

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.484
First, you two will give me your miraculous

00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:30.741
What? Look at that no funny joke and I know all of them

00:09:30.766 --> 00:09:32.217
But we can't do that.

00:09:32.242 --> 00:09:34.763
How are we going to defeat Shadow Moth without our Miraculous?

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.800
I'm going to give them to adult holders, carefully selected.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.767
like a legitimately responsible guardian would.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.960
Wait a second, we can't hand over our miraculous to a random guy

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:48.217
I-I... don't know...

00:09:48.242 --> 00:09:51.671
The Kwamis confirmed that he is the true original guardian of the box.

00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:55.530
Maybe Grand-Mestre Su-Han is right and Master Fu was wrong

00:09:55.555 --> 00:09:58.515
Maybe that's why we can't defeat Shadow Moth.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:03.115
That's ridiculous! You always managed to win, trust yourself, Ladybug, like I trust you.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.170
If I need to give him my miraculous, that's fine, I'll do it.

00:10:06.195 --> 00:10:10.326
But only if you ask me, you're the only guardian here.

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:14.798
Well, give me back your Miraculous and let's finish this.

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:18.307
Now you will renounce your Guardian's role, so that I can get the Miracle Box back.

00:10:18.332 --> 00:10:22.181
But if I do that, my memory will be erased, like the memory of Master Fu

00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:25.540
Does that mean you'll forget me?

00:10:30.417 --> 00:10:31.883
You want my ring?

00:10:31.922 --> 00:10:33.399
COME GET IT

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:34.299
Okay, then.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.760
Cat Noir, stay calm. We are talking to the Guardian. We will find a solution.

00:10:41.284 --> 00:10:44.296
Why do you think that the Guardians train for so many years?

00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:46.829
To give Miraculous to just ANYONE?

00:10:46.854 --> 00:10:51.633
No, we are especially trained to dominate any rebellious Miraculous holders.

00:10:51.971 --> 00:10:52.775
Like you!

00:10:53.034 --> 00:10:54.157
Celestial Storm!

00:10:54.182 --> 00:10:56.796
Thousands of fists will knock you on the floor

00:10:56.821 --> 00:10:57.446
[...] FIGHTS

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:02.454
My goodness, Master Fu was a lot nicer.

00:11:02.502 --> 00:11:04.375
His Mira-Kung-Fu was a lot worse.

00:11:08.927 --> 00:11:12.694
Grand Master, as far as I know, I am the Guardian

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:16.733
and I say that Cat Noir can keep his Miraculous and I can keep mine!

00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:18.531
SUBORDINATE INSOLENCE!

00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:23.146
Game of Justice! Knock down the enemy!

00:11:23.611 --> 00:11:26.712
I don't know how he does it but he guess every move we do!

00:11:29.617 --> 00:11:31.131
My Mira-Kung-Fu is like water.

00:11:31.162 --> 00:11:33.130
It adapts and always finds a way.

00:11:33.155 --> 00:11:36.630
You are at the mercy of the current of the river.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.800
Cat Noir, take his scepter!

00:11:45.815 --> 00:11:51.180
The claws of a hungry kitten are powerless against the milkman's iron pole.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.232
En garde my lord.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.800
THE KNIGHT ESCAPED?

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.200
GOTCHA

00:12:00.225 --> 00:12:00.636
What?!?

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:01.800
Take that!

00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:18.701
If you challenge the clouds, you will face the THUNDER

00:12:21.374 --> 00:12:24.319
I feel a mixture of misterious emotions

00:12:24.344 --> 00:12:26.436
An unappreciated authority

00:12:26.461 --> 00:12:28.827
A confused and defeated man.

00:12:28.852 --> 00:12:31.883
And most importantly an anger ready to explode.

00:12:33.672 --> 00:12:35.882
Fly away, my little akuma

00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:39.739
And let the lava of punishment explode from that volcanic heart!

00:12:49.256 --> 00:12:54.113
If I still had my staff I would find you immediately

00:12:55.294 --> 00:12:55.645
Fu!

00:13:00.576 --> 00:13:02.654
Give me your staff, crybaby.

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:04.200
You don't deserve it.

00:13:04.225 --> 00:13:05.119
Is your head okay?

00:13:05.144 --> 00:13:06.878
Leave my husband alone!

00:13:09.345 --> 00:13:10.173
An akuma!

00:13:10.416 --> 00:13:13.892
Swirl of wisdom. The virtuous wind. Resist temptation.

00:13:14.345 --> 00:13:18.424
My anger is mine. But I am not my anger (x2)

00:13:20.751 --> 00:13:24.032
Enough! Fool!
You are wasting precious time!

00:13:28.838 --> 00:13:31.104
Marianne, are you okay?

00:13:33.643 --> 00:13:35.171
Where do you think you're going?

00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:39.885
You shall apologise to her and give me back my cane now!
You brute!

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.260
Ah- I see that all is not lost after all!

00:13:43.285 --> 00:13:44.854
Fly closer little akuma!

00:13:50.731 --> 00:13:53.083
Fu! We meet again!

00:13:53.116 --> 00:13:54.997
Do I know you?

00:13:55.107 --> 00:13:56.107
Furious Fu,

00:13:56.394 --> 00:13:57.644
I am Shadow Moth

00:13:58.013 --> 00:14:01.161
That thief disrespected you and your partner.

00:14:01.186 --> 00:14:05.138
I will give you the power to make him pay.
You'll show him who's boss!

00:14:05.296 --> 00:14:08.969
All I ask in return is Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:14:09.128 --> 00:14:12.710
Can you repeat please? I did not understand everything

00:14:12.792 --> 00:14:16.936
*sigh* Do you want to take revenge on this man and recover your staff?

00:14:16.969 --> 00:14:18.428
Yes. I do.

00:14:18.453 --> 00:14:19.453
So, let’s hurry up!

00:14:28.814 --> 00:14:29.814
Which way did he go?

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.897
My love, please, it’s not worth it.

00:14:32.922 --> 00:14:36.800
That miserable frog won’t spit on the dragon without apologizing!

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.171
Find him!

00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:50.087
What are we going to do? Hide the box?

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.161
But then what? He knows who I am and where I live!

00:14:54.346 --> 00:14:57.870
Ladybug! Cat Noir! Give me back the Mother-box and your miraculous.

00:14:58.338 --> 00:15:00.187
Return it to the right hands!

00:15:00.212 --> 00:15:01.375
Look! It’s Master Fu’s walking stick!

00:15:04.056 --> 00:15:07.056
I want my walking stick. And apologize!

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:16.800
Thunder!

00:15:19.123 --> 00:15:20.094
Give it to me!

00:15:20.164 --> 00:15:20.800
Never!

00:15:29.437 --> 00:15:31.800
Furious Fu, bring me that box!

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:50.308
GOOOAL!!

00:15:52.573 --> 00:15:53.176
Hey!

00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:58.041
Teleportation!

00:16:06.417 --> 00:16:08.259
1-0 Ladybug.

00:16:08.284 --> 00:16:10.951
Red Card! He touched the ball with his hand.

00:16:22.667 --> 00:16:25.705
Higher! Be careful!

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.454
Not like that. Slow down, slow down.

00:16:29.479 --> 00:16:30.815
Not like that!

00:16:32.542 --> 00:16:35.300
Hey bossy, can you help a little over here?

00:16:35.325 --> 00:16:39.217
Mira-Ku it's a martial art to neutralize rebellious miraculous holders,

00:16:39.242 --> 00:16:42.548
not fighting with the supervillains, created with the Miraculous' magic.

00:16:42.573 --> 00:16:45.146
So do we need to fix your mistakes?

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.584
Ghost palms of resurrection, the wise man moves moutains without touching.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.800
You're the next one!

00:16:56.495 --> 00:16:58.495
Claws of the One Hundread Dragons!

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:03.808
Steel foot breaks the stone.

00:17:03.833 --> 00:17:05.800
The rage of the centipede with a ingrown nail.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.689
Statue!

00:17:07.948 --> 00:17:09.079
Finally :)

00:17:09.274 --> 00:17:14.837
Congratulations Furious Fu, keep your promise and bring to me the Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses.

00:17:14.862 --> 00:17:17.862
Fine, I need to bring the bat's bell without wings, right?

00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:20.687
No, not the bell. The ring!

00:17:20.712 --> 00:17:23.176
I'm not a bat without wings!

00:17:23.465 --> 00:17:25.963
Cat Noir, hold on. We'll never be able to defeat him.

00:17:25.988 --> 00:17:26.487
What?

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:29.611
We just need him not to defeat us, kitty.

00:17:29.636 --> 00:17:30.330
I don't get it.

00:17:30.355 --> 00:17:32.540
I've to make a call. Cover me.

00:17:32.565 --> 00:17:33.565
That I can do.

00:17:39.104 --> 00:17:42.876
The kitten can meow whenever he wants but he'll never roar like a tiger.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.176
Lucky charm!

00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:03.609
Perfect

00:18:10.182 --> 00:18:11.517
What is she going to do?

00:18:18.039 --> 00:18:18.547
Vision!

00:18:23.992 --> 00:18:27.257
Oh, so that's your ridiculous plan... isn't it?

00:18:27.282 --> 00:18:29.070
I know just what to do

00:18:32.264 --> 00:18:33.475
We haven't finished yet

00:18:39.466 --> 00:18:40.122
Cataclysm!

00:18:41.318 --> 00:18:42.083
Noo!

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.013
You're going to transform into cat food!

00:18:48.038 --> 00:18:49.544
Take this!

00:18:50.591 --> 00:18:51.216
and this!

00:18:55.356 --> 00:18:57.931
Soon! Voila, we won!

00:18:57.956 --> 00:18:59.478
Won, silly girl?

00:18:59.503 --> 00:19:00.478
We are stuck.

00:19:00.503 --> 00:19:03.217
You can't defeat me and I can't defeat you either.

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:06.106
Oh! But my plan was never to defeat you by myself.

00:19:06.295 --> 00:19:08.279
Excuse me! I'd like to borrow this

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:09.257
There!

00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:13.009
Just like you asked me on the phone Ladybug...

00:19:13.487 --> 00:19:14.854
Thank you very much Marianne

00:19:14.879 --> 00:19:15.996
It was perfect!

00:19:16.394 --> 00:19:18.066
No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:24.126
Time to de-evilize!

00:19:28.331 --> 00:19:29.066
Gotcha.

00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:32.010
Bye Bye, little butterfly!

00:19:34.151 --> 00:19:34.456
Ah

00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:35.938
Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:42.361 --> 00:19:42.939
Pound i-

00:19:43.151 --> 00:19:43.736
Oops!

00:19:43.761 --> 00:19:44.331
Sorry!

00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:47.254
Pound it!

00:19:55.693 --> 00:19:56.542
Take this.

00:19:56.567 --> 00:19:58.512
Keep it with you at all times.

00:19:58.677 --> 00:20:00.476
It will protect you from future attacks.

00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:02.930
And it will be a reminder of you every day

00:20:03.108 --> 00:20:05.110
Thank you, Ladygirl and Mr. Bat

00:20:06.508 --> 00:20:07.626
I'm really sorry.

00:20:07.829 --> 00:20:09.112
Please forgive me, crybab-

00:20:09.137 --> 00:20:10.456
I mean... sir!

00:20:11.308 --> 00:20:11.917
I..

00:20:12.192 --> 00:20:14.918
mistook you for someone who has been gone for a very long time

00:20:16.152 --> 00:20:17.519
Don't worry about it.

00:20:17.544 --> 00:20:19.208
All that can be forgotten

00:20:22.039 --> 00:20:25.570
Watch out for your Miracle Box, Guardian of the Miraculous

00:20:25.595 --> 00:20:28.062
You won't want to lose it, AGAIN

00:20:31.194 --> 00:20:33.741
The bat and red bug were amazing!

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:34.662
Paris is amazing!

00:20:34.687 --> 00:20:37.958
There are always people ready to dedicate themselves to the greater good.

00:20:38.122 --> 00:20:39.505
Just like you Marinette!

00:20:39.884 --> 00:20:41.798
You know? You should really be thanking Marianne.

00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:45.034
From what I heard, she was the real hero of the day!

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.926
Involving Marianne in the fight...

00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:53.899
a human with no powers is against the rules.

00:20:53.978 --> 00:20:55.431
This proved two things.

00:20:55.456 --> 00:20:58.706
The first one is that you are capable of making your own rules

00:20:58.731 --> 00:21:00.755
And as crazy as they might seem,

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.372
they somehow work!

00:21:03.371 --> 00:21:07.300
The second one is that your natural instincts show you who you can trust.

00:21:07.325 --> 00:21:09.457
a quality that is needed in a guardian.

00:21:09.482 --> 00:21:14.641
And crybaby, sorry...
Master Fu might not have made such a bad choice after all

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:20.633
This Miracle Box is the mother of all boxes:
The first to be created.

00:21:20.658 --> 00:21:23.669
And this one has some of the most powerful jewels.

00:21:23.694 --> 00:21:27.826
I can only imagine what would happen if it fell into the wrong hands.

00:21:28.491 --> 00:21:30.618
But I will trust you Marinette.

00:21:32.414 --> 00:21:34.250
I'll keep watching over you, from afar.

00:21:34.275 --> 00:21:39.307
Warning: Fail ONCE, and I'll take the box back.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.088
I'll make the most of my time in Paris
and learn more about modern life.

00:21:45.018 --> 00:21:49.051
How am I supposed to be a good guardian
if I don't try and understand the world around me?

Thank you, Master.

00:21:50.387 --> 00:21:51.973
I have something for you too!

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.974
I think you'll need these

00:21:57.541 --> 00:21:59.815

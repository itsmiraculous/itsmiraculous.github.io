WEBVTT

00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:03.476
In the daytime

00:00:03.594 --> 00:00:04.831
I'm Marinette

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.708
Just a normal girl, with a normal life

00:00:07.747 --> 00:00:09.192
But there's something about me

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.898
that no one knows yet.

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:12.096
Because, I have a secret!

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.140
Miraculous!

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:15.560
Simply the best!

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.886
Up to the test when things go wrong!

00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:20.156
Miraculous,

00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:21.275
the luckiest!

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.780
The power of love always so strong!

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.882
Miraculous!

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.177
Miraculous!

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:32.667
Guiltrip

00:00:46.556 --> 00:00:50.123
Miss Bustier, can I go to the nurse, please?
Miss Dora is back!

00:00:50.648 --> 00:00:52.574
And we can't keep Miss Dora waiting!

00:00:52.638 --> 00:00:55.316
Marinette, can accompany Rose to the nurse's office?

00:00:55.464 --> 00:00:56.857
Marinette?

00:00:57.062 --> 00:00:58.062
Yes, of course!

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.199
So… Who is Miss Dora?

00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:06.031
An imaginary friend like Lilly the unicorn you had in 6th grade?

00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:07.021
*giggles*

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:11.387
No, Dora is a nickname I give when my head is hurting

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.234
And that reminds me never to leave home without Mr Coffee!

00:01:15.078 --> 00:01:16.999
Good Morning, I'm Mr Coffee!

00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:18.639
The most important snack for your health

00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:23.896
I love how you see the world with your colorful glasses Rose!

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.195
Return to class when you can,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.708
and don't forget to greet Maria for me!

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.998
Maria?

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:28.960
Nurse Maria!

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.049
Dont worry!

00:01:33.484 --> 00:01:35.349
I never take too long with Maria!

00:01:38.622 --> 00:01:41.385
Everything is fine with Rose, don't worry guys!

00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:54.747
Juleka, if you eat Mr Mosso

00:01:54.772 --> 00:01:57.134
A snack full of energy that helps you so much that

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.810
Miss Dora can visit you too!

00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:02.095
Juleka? It was a joke!

00:02:02.403 --> 00:02:04.000
Wait Juleka!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
JULEKA!!!

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.347
Aww

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:25.269
I know this feeling of loneliness and anxiety that no one shares...

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.628
That only an akuma can relieve...

00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:37.920
Fly, and evilize this lonely heart

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.427
Juleka!

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:47.422
Ah!

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.901
Uh, excuse me, Adrien! I didn’t mean to mump-

00:02:51.926 --> 00:02:53.698
I mean to bump into you!

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:56.000
Come on, Marinette!
Now is not the time for this nonsense!

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I’m looking for Juleka, I was talking to her
in the cafeteria but she ran off crying

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.199
Maybe she’s in there?

00:03:05.274 --> 00:03:14.923
U00! Sorry! I’m just so passionate, I mean, worried
about Juleka- that’s why I’m nervous and clumsy

00:03:15.313 --> 00:03:19.000
I’m such a fool, I don’t know if she’s upset
because of something that I said

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Not all the things you say make sense, Marinette.
But, they’re never mean. There has to be another reason

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.351
Come on, let’s go look for her.

00:03:31.972 --> 00:03:32.578
Uh

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Wait here, and don’t say a word, ok?
I’ll talk to her

00:03:37.432 --> 00:03:39.608
Juleka, are you alright?

00:03:41.062 --> 00:03:42.975
I want to be alone

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.473
Do you want to be alone? I understand.

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:48.000
Everything is fine!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.000
They found Juleka

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.038
She’s in the boiler room!

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.489
In the boiler room!?

00:03:52.778 --> 00:03:56.450
I’m so sorry. I’m the worst class representative ever.

00:03:56.475 --> 00:03:59.751
But I don’t understand, did I say something that made you upset?

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:04.731
It’s not you, it’s Rose

00:04:05.532 --> 00:04:07.000
What do you mean, it’s Rose?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I’m worried about her

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Uh, don’t worry, she’s okay!
She just went to get some rest in the nurse's office.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.085
Juleka, you know you can tell us anything,
we’re your friends and I promise I won’t tell anyone

00:04:23.578 --> 00:04:26.000
Wait. Rose isn’t in the infirmary!?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
SHE’S IN THE HOSPITAL!?

00:04:29.312 --> 00:04:30.312
Yeah, she is

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Why is she at the hospital?

00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:37.978
She got sick when she was little and...

00:04:38.003 --> 00:04:38.492
*gasps*

00:04:38.517 --> 00:04:40.626
She got sick when she was little?

00:04:40.827 --> 00:04:41.827
But she's alright now, right?

00:04:42.305 --> 00:04:43.407
It can come back at any second-

00:04:43.432 --> 00:04:45.000
IT CAN COME BACK AT ANY SECOND?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.860
But she's always so bubbly and happy,
we would’ve never thought-

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.960
She made me promise I wouldn't tell you guys.

00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:53.541
U00, of course, she made you promise to not tell us.

00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:55.560
Please don’t tell her I told you.

00:04:55.585 --> 00:04:59.144
Stay calm Juleka, we won’t treat her
any differently because of that.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.414
Rose will never know you told us!

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:07.357
I’m reprogramming my software to give me any future information about this sad story.

00:05:07.684 --> 00:05:12.783
I’ll never say anything, not even
if I get bitten by a zombie dolphin.

00:05:12.808 --> 00:05:14.158
Never. Ever.

00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.950
It’s okay Juleka, you kept this secret for the amount of time you could,

00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:22.975
but it was too sad for you to keep it for yourself.

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:24.000
Thank you!

00:05:24.126 --> 00:05:25.702
That's what friends are for!

00:05:25.727 --> 00:05:28.000
Rose trusts you and you can trust us

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.787
We won’t say anything, but now we
know what you’ve been through

00:05:30.812 --> 00:05:32.540
and we can help you if you need it.

00:05:35.904 --> 00:05:36.904
Impossible!

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:40.633
How did that huge chasm between emotion and despair disappear?

00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:49.696
GOOD MORNING!

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.169
You see? I said everything was fine!

00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:02.834
Hi Juleka, Hi Rose!

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.035
Hi!

00:06:04.504 --> 00:06:05.504
Hi girls!

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.912
Hi!

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.502
I love you Rose! I don’t think I say that enough.

00:06:11.118 --> 00:06:13.341
I really like you too Marinette!

00:06:13.366 --> 00:06:16.067
Rose! You’re the school’s sunshine!

00:06:16.092 --> 00:06:19.598
Everyone’s mood increases 90% when around you.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:20.950
Correct Markov!

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:23.975
You’re the sound that brings happiness to our life’s dance floor.

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.000
You guys are so important to me too,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and you're right, we don’t say this enough!

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.960
What an amazing way to start off the day!!

00:06:39.327 --> 00:06:41.919
Thank you, but it's not that heavy, you know..

00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:42.552
Err--

00:06:42.577 --> 00:06:44.577
Lifting your bag is a good exercise for me

00:06:46.751 --> 00:06:48.751
(giggles) thank you!

00:06:48.983 --> 00:06:53.336
These chairs are so uncomfortable, so I decided to make pillows for everyone

00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:55.421
And by chance, you are gonna be the first one to try it

00:06:55.603 --> 00:06:57.603
Oh, ok! (laughs nervously)

00:06:58.288 --> 00:07:02.576
Ok, I´m going to write all your school notes,
so you don't get tired!

00:07:03.334 --> 00:07:06.670
Thank you, but I like writing my notes!

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:17.140
Oh, you can both pass in front

00:07:17.165 --> 00:07:20.834
Let Rose pass! Get out of the way, please! Let Rose pass!

00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:21.352
Emmm..

00:07:21.701 --> 00:07:25.000
Because that's gonna make me feel happy…

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:41.667
I've got the feeling that you need to tell me something,
am I right?

00:07:44.556 --> 00:07:45.237
Come with me!

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:48.033
I told them about you

00:07:48.852 --> 00:07:50.854
You told them!

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:54.262
Oh no, they will never treat me normally again!

00:07:56.523 --> 00:08:01.298
No, It's all my fault, I shouldn't have told you my secret

00:08:01.343 --> 00:08:03.408
I made you worry with me all the time

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.434
Hey! You know what!?
No problem.

00:08:05.537 --> 00:08:06.630
I'm going to solve this

00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:08.740
I should have told them a long time ago

00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:11.765
I'm going to explain everything to them,
and everything is going to go back to normal!

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.140
I was worried, you were there for 4 minutes and 47 seconds

00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:23.906
and people spend an average of 3 minutes
and 24 seconds in the bathroom!

00:08:24.062 --> 00:08:26.000
I was about to tear that door off

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.125
I was almost going to dive there to save you!

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.183
(Sighs) I'm seeing I made everyone worried

00:08:31.208 --> 00:08:32.069
I'm sorry.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.405
I never told you about my illness until today,

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.583
because it isn't my problems that matter!

00:08:37.757 --> 00:08:39.757
It’s the way that I overcome it that matters.

00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:42.000
Do you know how I deal with it every day?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.269
Giving cute nicknames to them?

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.000
Always being generous?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.699
And always singing too loud?

00:08:48.898 --> 00:08:49.898
Exactly!

00:08:49.923 --> 00:08:51.454
And I always want to be that Rose.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.827
I don’t want you to see me differently.

00:08:53.852 --> 00:08:55.000
I want you to be my friends.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.758
Who laugh and have fun with me!

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.654
And not carrying my stuff,

00:08:58.679 --> 00:08:59.975
nor giving me embroidered pillows,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
or worrying every time I go to the bathroom.

00:09:02.712 --> 00:09:04.584
I don’t want you to feel sorry for me,

00:09:04.609 --> 00:09:06.609
because there is no one happier than me.

00:09:07.016 --> 00:09:07.399
Okay?

00:09:08.523 --> 00:09:10.523
No more embroidered pillows, I promise.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.828
No more exercises carrying your bag.

00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:14.645
And enough of exaggerated affection.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But, I like your affection.

00:09:19.496 --> 00:09:20.975
Awwww

00:09:21.922 --> 00:09:24.777
See? I told you everything was going to be okay.

00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:31.421
Today we are going to study viruses, germs, bacteria.

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.853
And everything terrible that it causes.

00:09:37.056 --> 00:09:38.975
Quick, call her parents. Quickly! Put this on.

00:09:39.616 --> 00:09:40.616
I can’t talk with her parents.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Nino, call an ambulance!

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:46.518
Stop!

00:09:49.035 --> 00:09:50.035
You promised me.

00:09:51.482 --> 00:09:52.482
Sorry.

00:09:53.133 --> 00:09:55.081
Oh no! Juleka wait!

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.712
Much stronger than a painful secret.

00:10:00.737 --> 00:10:03.475
More painful than the anguish of loneliness.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.000
It's the guilt of the girl who betrayed her best friend.

00:10:07.589 --> 00:10:10.589
She digs a dark well in her heart.

00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:16.000
Fly away my akuma, and bring this amok with you.

00:10:23.611 --> 00:10:24.611
Juleka!

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Juleka, sorry! It was my fault! Open the door !

00:10:28.437 --> 00:10:29.383
It was my fault!

00:10:29.408 --> 00:10:30.196
I’m sorry!!

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:32.797
Everybody is feeling guilty because of me...

00:10:32.822 --> 00:10:34.822
Oh no! Juleka! No one is feeling guilty because of you!

00:10:36.843 --> 00:10:37.408
Juleka!

00:10:37.534 --> 00:10:39.354
Juleka, answer me! Juleka!

00:10:42.694 --> 00:10:45.455
Reflekta, I am ShadowMoth.

00:10:45.859 --> 00:10:49.768
Why let yourself get taken by such intense guilty feelings,

00:10:49.793 --> 00:10:54.853
when you can use them against
everyone that promised to keep your secret?

00:10:54.878 --> 00:10:57.878
Juleka, please resist!
Don’t listen to him!

00:11:00.156 --> 00:11:01.340
Wait! I’ll be right back.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Your sentimonster, Guilt, is perfect.

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:08.879
Everyone that broke the promise and is ruining your friend’s life

00:11:08.904 --> 00:11:11.548
are going to get into a Guiltrip!

00:11:11.908 --> 00:11:14.164
The first person to take the guilt is me.

00:11:20.364 --> 00:11:21.364
No! Wait!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.506
Juleka is almost being akumatized!

00:11:24.546 --> 00:11:25.126
Someone help!

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:28.221
I’m a science teacher, not a superheroine.

00:11:28.335 --> 00:11:30.453
Remain seated and…

00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:40.551
Plagg claws out!

00:11:41.836 --> 00:11:43.297
Tikki spots on!

00:11:49.939 --> 00:11:50.939
What is that thing?

00:11:55.859 --> 00:11:57.963
Kids, get back to class!

00:12:00.417 --> 00:12:02.975
Keep calm Juleka, I’ll save you!

00:12:03.218 --> 00:12:05.218
Wait! We’ll take you to a safe place!

00:12:05.609 --> 00:12:08.736
My friend Juleka is in there and I’m not leaving her alone!

00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:12.600
Looks like we are going to play explorers!

00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:13.448
Hold still!

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.978
The wind is too strong, I can’t hold it anymore!

00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:34.000
Yes! Ladybug and Cat Noir, you fell directly into my trap!

00:12:34.025 --> 00:12:36.025
And you’re never escaping it!

00:12:36.183 --> 00:12:38.338
Your Miraculous are mine!

00:12:44.564 --> 00:12:47.240
Damn, it's colder on the inside!

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.189
I don't know

00:12:48.214 --> 00:12:49.567
I've got a weird feeling...

00:12:52.335 --> 00:12:52.835
Be careful!

00:12:57.859 --> 00:12:59.859
This looks like a huge pinball machine!

00:13:00.601 --> 00:13:02.601
Yeah, but it looks like it is in multiball mode.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.144
Everyone was captured because of me.

00:13:08.578 --> 00:13:10.972
Everyone was captured because of me.

00:13:12.007 --> 00:13:13.007
What's up with him?

00:13:13.032 --> 00:13:14.683
Everyone was captured because of me.

00:13:17.656 --> 00:13:19.656
Am I seeing this right? Did he just transform into Reflekta?

00:13:19.875 --> 00:13:22.159
She must have been reakumatized by Shadow Moth.

00:13:22.184 --> 00:13:23.434
And that thing?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.487
It is her sentimonster!

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:27.456
We must find out where Reflekta is hiding.

00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:28.934
She must be controlling this.

00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:29.542
Be alert!

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.280
I shouldn't have let them leave the classroom

00:13:34.305 --> 00:13:36.305
I shouldn't have let them leave the classroom

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.018
This sentimonster is infecting everyone with these purple balls

00:13:42.242 --> 00:13:44.243
It is not going to be easy to find the real Reflekta!

00:13:44.268 --> 00:13:45.313
Everyone is looking like her.

00:13:45.523 --> 00:13:47.523
If i was wearing my competition shorts

00:13:47.548 --> 00:13:49.536
I would have been faster for sure

00:13:49.655 --> 00:13:52.546
I shouldn't have let go of Ivan’s hand.

00:13:52.656 --> 00:13:55.389
They all look the same but their voice is still their own.

00:13:55.672 --> 00:13:59.672
I can't help my best friend face his father

00:14:00.358 --> 00:14:01.358
No, Nino!

00:14:04.117 --> 00:14:05.117
This is our fault.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.594
If we had defeated Shadow Moth they would not be stuck in this trap.

00:14:09.859 --> 00:14:12.437
Oh no, this can't be happening. Not right now!

00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:15.875
Hmfp… Cataclysm!

00:14:20.093 --> 00:14:21.093
Chat Noir! No!

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
If we turn into Reflekta we will be paralyzed
and Shadow Moth can take our Miraculous.

00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:29.726
We should give him our miraculous.

00:14:31.156 --> 00:14:32.460
You're right, Kitty.

00:14:32.609 --> 00:14:35.076
How could I believe that we could beat

00:14:35.101 --> 00:14:38.209
a sentimonster so powerful, on ourselves?

00:14:39.954 --> 00:14:40.264
*gasps*

00:14:40.732 --> 00:14:43.646
Ladybug! Chat Noir! You are amazing!

00:14:43.671 --> 00:14:44.847
I knew you would come to save us.

00:14:47.109 --> 00:14:48.710
I'm so sorry that you had to come.

00:14:48.735 --> 00:14:51.235
It is my fault. I'm not a good friend

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.891
I should never have told Juleka my secret

00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:56.891
No! I can't think like that!

00:14:56.916 --> 00:14:59.312
No! It was good that I told her.
That was what made our friendship so strong!

00:15:03.064 --> 00:15:07.954
Of course!
She is fighting against the negativity by thinking positive!

00:15:07.979 --> 00:15:09.907
That's what prevents her from transforming into Reflekta

00:15:09.932 --> 00:15:12.932
We have to do the same! Cat Noir you can do it!
You have to think positive!

00:15:14.203 --> 00:15:16.062
You're the best partner anyone could ask for!

00:15:17.422 --> 00:15:18.922
Ladybug, you really think that?

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.374
Yes, and I don't say this very often
but I couldn't do any of this without you!

00:15:23.416 --> 00:15:25.416
And It would be less fun too!

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.140
Ah What a (meow) wonderful thing to hear!

00:15:30.554 --> 00:15:34.455
I also have to say that you're purrfect m'lady!

00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:36.814
I'm glad you're back, Kitty

00:15:36.839 --> 00:15:39.596
Do you really think we're gonna be able to defeat that thing?

00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:40.584
Of course!

00:15:40.663 --> 00:15:42.962
Don't forget that I still have my...

00:15:43.051 --> 00:15:43.989
LUCKY CHARM

00:15:49.082 --> 00:15:52.147
Ah a pickaxe! Of course a pickaxe for… ah…

00:15:53.092 --> 00:15:53.950
Uh-

00:15:56.304 --> 00:15:57.723
You don't know what to do with it?

00:15:58.585 --> 00:15:59.975
Of course I do, I'm just making suspense

00:16:01.115 --> 00:16:02.883
I could use my cataclysm

00:16:02.996 --> 00:16:06.756
but making the sentimonster be out of control with us inside it?

00:16:06.848 --> 00:16:09.132
Maybe it's not be the best idea, right?

00:16:09.457 --> 00:16:10.989
No, it's not

00:16:11.014 --> 00:16:14.093
Uh… all this negativity is messing with my head

00:16:14.249 --> 00:16:15.359
Go Ladybug!

00:16:17.498 --> 00:16:20.312
You'll manage to save my friend Juleka because I believe in you!

00:16:20.477 --> 00:16:23.163
Yes, but we need more positivity for that

00:16:23.296 --> 00:16:25.286
I already know who can help us!

00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:17.473
Go Cat Noir! You're guys are the best!

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Rose Lavillant, This is the pig miraculous,
that gives the power of Joy!

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.000
You will use it for the Greater good!

00:16:37.359 --> 00:16:40.359
WOW! It's so beautiful.

00:16:43.693 --> 00:16:47.000
Wow, you're so cute. What's your name?

00:16:47.348 --> 00:16:49.801
My name is Daizzi, and I'm your kwami.

00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:54.379
The kwamis give us the powers.
You only have to say the words "Daizzi, Rejoice!"

00:16:56.374 --> 00:16:58.374
Daizzi Rejoice!!

00:17:13.446 --> 00:17:15.446
Chat noir I present you. Oh...

00:17:16.022 --> 00:17:17.022
Pigella!

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.805
Wow, looks like you found a solution, My Lady.

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:22.731
I told you to think positive!

00:17:22.756 --> 00:17:24.756
I'm can't wait to see our friend in action!

00:17:24.781 --> 00:17:25.781
Come, let's go

00:17:27.677 --> 00:17:32.677
Because of me, everyone feels guilt:
Rose, Marinette, Adrien, Ivan, Mylene.

00:17:33.117 --> 00:17:38.452
Because of me, everyone feels guilt:
Rose, Marinette, Adrien, Ivan, Mylene.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
For my fault everyone feels guilty

00:17:42.526 --> 00:17:43.526
Juleka!

00:17:43.551 --> 00:17:46.892
Rose, Marinette, Adrien, Ivan, Mylene

00:17:46.917 --> 00:17:51.917
Because of me, everyone feels guilt:
Rose, Marinette, Adrien, Ivan, Mylene.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.538
For my fault everyone feels guilt

00:17:56.531 --> 00:17:57.531
GIFT!

00:18:01.445 --> 00:18:03.740
Uh..  Is this a super power?

00:18:03.765 --> 00:18:07.765
Pigella's power shows the affected person the biggest wish in her heart!

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
A normal day in class , that everyone act normal with Rose

00:18:16.025 --> 00:18:19.933
This is... Juleka's biggest wish!

00:18:27.095 --> 00:18:28.908
Wow, Impressive!

00:18:28.933 --> 00:18:30.523
This is the power of positivity!!

00:18:30.548 --> 00:18:33.171
This worked perfectly to win the battle!

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.410
Got you! , bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:18:48.624 --> 00:18:50.635
Everything is okay now Juleka.

00:18:50.781 --> 00:18:54.774
I'm Pigella, and Ladybug and CatNoir saved you!

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.459
Uhh, the Sentimonster and its friends don’t seem very happy!

00:18:59.484 --> 00:19:01.546
We need to find out what object controls it!

00:19:02.509 --> 00:19:05.509
Juleka, do you remember where the amok entered?
You know the feather of Shadow Moth!

00:19:05.534 --> 00:19:06.222
Uhh.. I-It’s in the rubbish bin..

00:19:06.247 --> 00:19:08.247
You threw it in the rubbish bin?

00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:10.875
You won’t escape from the void of guilt!

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.950
You won't be able to escape the well of guilt!

00:19:13.975 --> 00:19:14.975
They will!

00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:18.391
And now let’s change the subject!

00:19:18.416 --> 00:19:19.416
Well done, Pigella!

00:19:19.441 --> 00:19:23.441
What is important is not the problems but how we fight them!

00:19:24.609 --> 00:19:26.609
We need to find out where that feather is hiding!

00:19:41.975 --> 00:19:43.975
It’s very strong! We won’t be able to get out!

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.975
Well, it looks like we ran out of luck!!

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.475
Luck?!...Of course!

00:19:48.346 --> 00:19:50.346
That’s what the lucky charm was for!

00:19:56.152 --> 00:19:57.152
Found you!

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Time to end evil!

00:20:10.816 --> 00:20:12.000
Gotcha!

00:20:13.035 --> 00:20:14.605
Bye-bye, little feather!

00:20:18.453 --> 00:20:26.109
You may have won with that positivity of yours, but you can count on me to fill those days with negativity!

00:20:26.134 --> 00:20:27.641
I know how it ends!

00:20:30.585 --> 00:20:31.585
Pound it!

00:20:41.922 --> 00:20:44.054
Juleka , this is a magical charm.

00:20:44.211 --> 00:20:47.466
It will protect you to not become a victim of Shadow Moth again!

00:20:49.852 --> 00:20:50.852
Miraculous Ladybug!

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.341
Thank you, Ladybug! Thank you so much for saving Juleka.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.965
You aren't going to hide with her to get her Miraculous, my Lady?

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:14.375
She already gave it to me.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.379
That girl is really incredible!

00:21:17.648 --> 00:21:19.648
She doesn't need a miraculous to be a superhero.

00:21:27.276 --> 00:21:28.779
I'm going to take back your present.

00:21:28.804 --> 00:21:30.880
You must wait for your birthday like everyone else!

00:21:31.193 --> 00:21:31.724
*Huh*

00:21:32.234 --> 00:21:34.234
Whats up, guys? She is not made of glass!

00:21:36.248 --> 00:21:38.630
Oh no, i'm going to faint from laughing too much!

00:21:38.655 --> 00:21:40.630
Someone take me to the nurse!

00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:46.114
Hey! Why does nobody laugh when I say something like that?

00:21:46.319 --> 00:21:48.598
Because in your case, it is never a joke.

00:21:48.623 --> 00:21:49.323
Hm.. That's true.

00:21:51.507 --> 00:21:53.989
It is really nice getting you all back.

00:21:54.042 --> 00:21:56.450
Please, don't ever change.

00:21:58.351 --> 00:21:58.846

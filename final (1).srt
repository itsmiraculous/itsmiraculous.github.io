1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,721
Tikki, I don't get it!

2
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:34,757
The enigma translated by Master Fu means nothing at all...

3
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:35,448
That’s normal!

4
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:39,029
Its meanings are hidden on purpose to
protect the secret of our magical powers

5
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:43,437
Okay but what about the fact that even I,
the guardian of the Miraculous, can’t understand.

6
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:47,623
Master Fu took time to find out too!
I know you’ll discover the secret soon, after all...

7
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:48,772
you helped him with the aquatic one!

8
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:50,936
You’re right, I’m not gonna give up!

9
00:00:51,972 --> 00:00:52,935
What are you doing?

10
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:57,939
Nadia: The city of paris is preparing to celebrate Prince Ali's birthday-

11
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:01,552
Alec: An exclusive report about Adrien's life..

12
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:03,726
Marinette: *Gasp* Adrien!

13
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,343
Reporter: We were able to follow the daily life of the famous model

14
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,046
Vincent: Perfect! Stunning! I need a smile more.. Al Dente!

15
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:16,147
A rank dragon degrades a rank dragon (x2)

16
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:19,375
Sarah: Not Bad, but do u think that you can do it a little more like.. orange?

17
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,380
Mari: *sigh* He really has an amazing life!

18
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,500
Adrien: Ugh.. What an endless day!

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,660
Plagg: Without a lunch break even! It's unbearable

20
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,700
Adrien: Here, I'm finally free!

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,060
Plagg, Claws Out!

22
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,620
Plagg: What? Ohh noooo

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
CatNoir: Bugaboo?

24
00:01:48,136 --> 00:01:50,157
"Ladybug here, leave a msg"

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,032
CatNoir: Hello Bugaboo, well I'm here on time as usual.. loyal to the post!

26
00:01:55,057 --> 00:01:57,777
It's time for our patrol.. you didn't forget right?

27
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,475
"no msgs but do not forget my cheese"

28
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,812
CatNoir: What could she be doing?!

29
00:02:13,837 --> 00:02:15,437
"Ladybug here, leave a msg"

30
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,380
Maybe now that you're the miraculous guardian, you've more important things to do..

31
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,100
but you know it's okay, I'm the cat for the job!

32
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,180
I'm starting without you, see you soon I hope, let me know.

33
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:35,795
Kids: What? It's ChatNoir! ChatNoir! ChatNoir!

34
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,460
CatNoir: I'll finally be able to stretch my legs!

35
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,460
Kids: ChatNoir!

36
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,900
Thank you so much!

37
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,340
CatNoir: In your service

38
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,180
"no msgs but do not forget my cheese"

39
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,376
*whistling*

40
00:02:53,314 --> 00:02:58,000
So Mister Banana tell me, you have punch,
the peach, the banana, you understand?

41
00:02:58,628 --> 00:02:59,705
Don’t worry, forget it.

42
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,713
Oh Mister Ramier, it's been a while that you haven’t been akumatised.

43
00:03:02,738 --> 00:03:08,296
You don't miss it a bit, being Mr. Pigeon? Don’t you feel a bit sad, desperate, angry, annoyed maybe?

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,294
Even a little disturbed?

45
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:13,975
Thank you for worrying about it Cat Noir
but I’m in an excellent mood lately!

46
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,390
Oh, so I’ll go.

47
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:18,975
Say hello to dear Ladybug from me!

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Of course... If I see her one day.

49
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:24,903
No messages but don’t forget my cheese.

50
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:27,933
A glass of milk as usual mister Cat Noir?

51
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:28,893
mhm!

52
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,975
How is dear Ladybug, she isn't making much
of an appearance at the moment…

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah,  it's particularly calm these days.

54
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,604
This bag was my life Sabrina and you find the way to lose it!

55
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:43,331
It’s no longer worth talking to me. Understand?

56
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:43,975
But- Chloé-

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,646
Shhh, you shut  up now.

58
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:47,624
But- Shut- and-  Shut! Shut! Shut!

59
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,134
Not a word. And I forbid you to look at me.

60
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:49,994
HIDE YOUR EYES.

61
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:50,929
(Gasp) huh-

62
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:52,921
It smells like akumatisation!

63
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:57,279
Oh- Oh- my bag!

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,975
What an idiot! You couldn’t say that it was here!?

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,975
But I was not allowed to speak, Chloe...

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And it’s always the case! But- Shut!

67
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:05,900
Oh-oh!

68
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:09,544
On second thought, I will take a double milk.

69
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:18,393
No messages but don’t forget my chee-
Here's ladybug! Leave a message!

70
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:22,975
Hello again, bugaboo.
Do you know who this is? It’s the one you stood up- huh?

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
YES! To never weaken, mother!

72
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,752
I learned the lesson well!

73
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,260
And never let-

74
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:29,395
yourself be surprised.

75
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:32,975
Apply these principles to fencing if you want to be better than Adrien Agreste!

76
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:37,948
Adrien? Don’t worry mother.
I have everything I need to succeed!

77
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:40,202
End of the patrol bugaboo!

78
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:44,083
Claws out.

79
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:58,011
On you forget it exists so much else,
and it’s a new variety, it might be a good surprise!

80
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,151
Miss Kagami Tsurugi called to signal that your
fencing class’s schedule changed again.

81
00:05:05,176 --> 00:05:06,261
It will be an hour early.

82
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:08,323
Ah, thank you, Nathalie

83
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:10,671
What are you hiding again, Kagami?

84
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:17,366
Those schedule changes imposed by the Agrestes are exhausting! But make the most of it to do one extra hour of Russian!

85
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:17,876
Yes mother

86
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:20,977
Those schedule changes imposed by the Tsurugis are exhausting!

87
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:24,935
Once you're home, don’t forget to try the
outfit that I’ve just finished for your next photoshoot

88
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:25,651
Of course, father

89
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:35,975
Hmmm? Kagami?? Adrien?? Your fencing class starts in 1 hour and Mr. D’Argencourt is not here yet!

90
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,975
OH! Really? And here I was sure of noting the right schedule this time!

91
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:41,501
I’m sorry but you can’t-

92
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:43,380
Stay here alone in school!

93
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:46,436
No problem M. Aprel. We’ll come back in 1 hour.

94
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:48,505
But what are you going to do, Kagami?

95
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,930
The art room?

96
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:54,909
But why did you bring me here?

97
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:57,062
I never told anyone.

98
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,845
But, I’m passionate about drawing.

99
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,465
And I always have been

100
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:06,465
Art never lies, poses people do always reflect their personalities

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But my mom doesn't let me draw, she thinks I'm not good enough…

102
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:12,734
You are incredibly talented Kagami!

103
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:14,225
Really? You think so?

104
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:14,799
Mhm!

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Make a pose for me, I would like to draw you

106
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,390
What pose do you want me to make?

107
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:20,819
A pose that you feel comfortable with

108
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,996
You know, I admire alot Toulause Lautreck,

109
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:26,324
I would like to draw you just like the characters he used to paint

110
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,012
Did you know that sometimes he used to sign his drawings with an ideogram?
In Japanese?

111
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:32,601
Ugh, I'm redoing it, this is not you.

112
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:34,508
Can I see it?

113
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,323
Make another pose.

114
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:41,040
 It's easy to make a beautiful art of you since you're beautiful, but I wanna draw the real you, what you are in the inside.

115
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,460
No… Still not you. Change your pose

116
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:51,305
These are model poses, try something more natural, more like you!

117
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:53,798
Hmm… What do you think of CAT!

118
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:58,389
Uhh no.. uhmm… I mean, do you prefer… this pose??

119
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,492
No, this is absolutely not natural.

120
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:02,959
Yes it is, I promise, this is really me!

121
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,367
NO! This is you when you're acting like a clown!

122
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:08,002
But maybe when I act like a clown… it’s really me..

123
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:17,249
That way, that’s who you really are.

124
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,231
But.. are you sure?

125
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:21,858
Yes, you are.. Perfect.

126
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:29,228
Seems like it’s really time for fencing lessons now.

127
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,197
Ready?

128
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:38,553
Set!

129
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:40,535
Go!

130
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:48,147
Touché

131
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:49,473
En garde..

132
00:07:54,663 --> 00:07:57,481
Uh, sorry I forgot something in the locker room

133
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:09,511
It’s time for our patrol!

134
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,975
You didn't forget right?

135
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:11,790
BOO!

136
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,077
Cat Noir?

137
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
(AAHHHH) I talked to him, and oh?

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Won’t you stop with your stupid jokes, I could have hurt you!

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,611
M’lady, the only thing that hurts...

140
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:27,720
It's the fact of you leaving me on patrol alone...

141
00:08:27,868 --> 00:08:30,168
I even missed your angry little looks.

142
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:33,646
I'm a sorry kitten. I'm very busy nowadays...

143
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:38,000
You amaze me, guardian of the miraculous,
with great title comes great responsibilities!

144
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:40,025
I promise I won't forget our patrols anymore.

145
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:50,745
Kagami !

146
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,942
I have to go home my father must be worried...

147
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:07,202
See you tomorrow !

148
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:11,433
Oh, see you tomorrow everyone !

149
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:25,075
I forgot something in class, I'll call you later!

150
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Tatsu, go.

151
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:35,232
Great! Yeah!

152
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:38,975
Ah, and I filmed it all dude, this concert was just great!

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,184
Not really Nino, I completely missed the intro..

154
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,209
No problem, we can do it again, Adrien..

155
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes! We're going to play the song again!

156
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,244
Adrien, it's time..

157
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:48,446
Five little minutes?

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,808
Well, I’ll do better next time, promise

159
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:52,595
See you tommorow guys!

160
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:11,078
Weird, The cars are not here yet

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,106
It’s a shame, we could have replayed the song

162
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:16,975
But at least that gives us a little more time together

163
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:20,000
Don’t worry, we’ll have enough time together especially that we’re going to Prince Ali’s birthday together

164
00:10:20,444 --> 00:10:22,444
I meant only us two

165
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,662
You know, I’m so happy with you.

166
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:27,834
I think that we’re very similar

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you feel the same way? Do you also...

168
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:36,249
Uh.. sorry I thought that there was a wasp

169
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:38,904
Do you love me, as well?

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You were saying?

171
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,540
Adrien... What’s the matter?

172
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:45,664
I’ve lost something on the boat when my bag fell, don’t wait for me

173
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,140
See you at the birthday party!

174
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:52,968
Tatsu, Take me to the town hall

175
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,223
I still hope we’ll be going to the prince’s birthday, it’s always a big ceremony where they get the best cheese

176
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:05,000
For now Ladybug needs me

177
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,250
PLAGG, CLAWS OUT!

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,065
Cat Noir, HawkMoth merged his powers with those of the peacock to become ShadowMoth.

179
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,850
He created a supervillain and a sentimonster at the same time. Come quickly!

180
00:11:16,663 --> 00:11:21,663
You will now have to tell the truth to all questions you’ll be asked. I’ll start, who are you, Ladybug?

181
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:23,383
I.. Am-

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
A very good swimmer!

183
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:36,000
Dear Prince Ali, in the name of the city of Paris and its inhabitants, I wish you a happy birthday.

184
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,390
Didn’t I agree with Gabriel Agreste that you would come with his son?

185
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:45,533
Oh uh... He’s here, mother, he’s answering questions from journalists, I’ll be back.

186
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:59,255
Ahh, M’lady, it’s been a long time since I had so much fun

187
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:02,697
Haha, if fighting against a villain with three eyes and a giant Monster amuses you...

188
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,368
at this point, I can’t dare to imagine what your daily life looks like

189
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:10,829
A supervillain, a giant, and Shadowmoth!
Don’t you find this new name more amusing?

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He can change his name as much as he wants, we’ll catch him eventually!

191
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,734
You can count on me and my jokes, Buginette

192
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,705
You won’t have to do it for much longer

193
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:23,913
In truth, I only have so much fun with you, bye Buginette!

194
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:27,593
Claws in!

195
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:35,450
Kagami! I didn’t make you wait too long, I hope

196
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:39,928
And I hope you found what you are looking for. Huuh- On the barge!

197
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:42,896
On the barge... of course, yes yes I found it! Thank you.

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What was it? Ohh it’s this little lucky charm that Marinette gave it to me for uhh- no I lost it, again!

199
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,760
Are you talking about this?

200
00:12:55,916 --> 00:13:00,525
Listen, I lied too, I lied to my mother so that we could see each other,

201
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,775
I even lied to her that you came with me tonight,

202
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,594
I lied during every fencing class so I can spend more time with you!

203
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:13,187
Do you see? We are both liars, the difference is that I lie just to be with you.

204
00:13:13,212 --> 00:13:15,890
You! You lie to not be with me

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,500
Kagami!

206
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:23,421
I’d rather be alone.

207
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:35,694
It only takes one lie to ruin the confidence!
And what if in the end all is lies in our world?

208
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:42,000
Fly away my little akuma, and blackened this unhappy heart

209
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:54,573
Lies!

210
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:00,410
I’m Shadow Moth, I give you the power to rid the world of liars

211
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:04,099
In return, you must give me the Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

212
00:14:04,124 --> 00:14:05,609
Do you give me your word?

213
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:10,102
You can trust me. No lie will be tolerated, Shadow Moth!

214
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:14,789
Oh!

215
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:17,930
Nooo…

216
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,191
This is all my fault… I have to save Kagami!

217
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,364
Plagg Claws out!

218
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:49,181
Oh, Prince Ali, one more year is to be celebrated but you are still Rock and Roll in your head!

219
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:50,193
"Applause and Roar"

220
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,205
In the name of the law, what is that!

221
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,826
I'm Lies!

222
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:58,774
have you ever lied to Officer Roger?

223
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,756
Of course not! A policeman never lies.

224
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:02,781
You lie, officer Roger!

225
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:04,331
Aaaah

226
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:11,063
And you Mother? Have you ever lied?

227
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:11,975
Kagami!

228
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't permit you!

229
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,556
"Aaaaah"

230
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,301
"Gasps"

231
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,060
Kaga… Lie stop this now !

232
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:31,573
Oh but here is a new candidate for the lie detector test.

233
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,000
I am not lying to you when I tell you that I will free you from Shadow Moth!

234
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,025
Me I will help him, yeah!

235
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:37,711
Don't stay here Jagged.

236
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,800
I fear nothing, I'm an artist. I still hold to my fans.

237
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:43,825
It's wrong, you lie to them about your age!

238
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh, that's not Rock and Roll! You're...

239
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:50,518
A world without lies would no longer need superheroes at Noir.

240
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:56,398
Catacly…

241
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,343
No, If you touch the sphere you will be paralyzed.

242
00:15:58,368 --> 00:15:59,956
Unless you've never lied.

243
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:01,039
Yes, but is it the case?

244
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:02,064
Uh not really...

245
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,590
What about you?

246
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:08,610
Of course not kitty!
We have to lie, even just to keep our identities a secret!

247
00:16:08,656 --> 00:16:12,420
And if we touch this sphere, nothing will be able to stop it from annihilating Paris!

248
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:13,975
Okay, but what do we do then?

249
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,004
Lucky Charm!

250
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:25,802
I can't wait to know what you're going to do with a drone

251
00:16:25,877 --> 00:16:29,975
Okay, we can't go inside. This device has never lied before, which means...

252
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,730
Make diversion whilst I send our flying spy!

253
00:16:34,382 --> 00:16:35,382
Let's keep in contact

254
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,652
Your wish is my command m'lady. If I lie I'll go to hell ~

255
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,251
Youhouuu my name's not Chat Noir!
I am not a superhero!

256
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:45,133
I hate Ladybug!

257
00:16:45,158 --> 00:16:49,839
And I think that ShadowMoth could've called himself PanFly! It's funnier!

258
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:54,337
Oh yes, I was about to forget: my favorite dish is cabbage with white sauce!
Yummy!

259
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:57,827
Catch that lying cat, and grab his miraculous!

260
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:03,000
I won't go back on my words ShadowMoth,
liars always end up paying for their mistakes!

261
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:09,975
I know what the akumatized object is

262
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:11,203
Amazing! Break it then!

263
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,628
I don't how to do it without touching it

264
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:18,497
You're right, only someone who's never lied could infiltrate the sphere to do it, but such a person doesn't exist!

265
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:27,155
Of course, it exists Chat Noir, it really does!! Fang, Jagged Stone's crocodile!

266
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:29,482
It's an animal, it doesn't know how to lie!

267
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:30,842
Great thinking!

268
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:44,516
Yes! It's working!

269
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,958
Civilians : Heeeelp!

270
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:04,000
If Lies sees it coming, we’re screwed.

271
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,839
There are only two more liars left in Paris, and one of them knows how to turn his attention.

272
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:10,987
No, wait doesn’t do that, and what if I’m mistaken?

273
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:14,000
You know what? I trust you.

274
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,040
Cat Noir no! Don’t do that! You’re crazy!

275
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:17,065
Yes, crazy for you M’lady.

276
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:22,834
No, you’re just crazy unconscious.

277
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:30,163
It is the moment of truth. Take Cat Noir’s Miraculous and then it will be Ladybug’s turn.

278
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:33,872
Hurry up!

279
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:00,391
No!

280
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:03,298
No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

281
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:08,181
Time to de-evilize.

282
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:13,084
Gotcha!

283
00:19:14,116 --> 00:19:16,116
Bye-bye, little butterfly.

284
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:17,648
Miraculous Ladybug!

285
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,426
Seriously you need to stop doing this to me!

286
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:36,801
Yes, but it’s because I find that angry look of yours absolutely irresistible.

287
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:38,406
Pound it!

288
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,264
Plagg, claws in.

289
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:45,066
Ah, Ladybug.

290
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:53,659
Oh how romantic that is, I mean I understand you even though I love every cheese, I always come back to my favorite, camembert.

291
00:19:57,081 --> 00:20:00,971
On guard. Ready. Go

292
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:09,828
Ouch hey!

293
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Is enough!

294
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:14,650
It's a fencing lesson here, not a personal problem-solving.

295
00:20:15,187 --> 00:20:16,187
Cease it!

296
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,975
I'm sorry for hurting you Kagami.

297
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And you know all the good times we shared

298
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It was not lies

299
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I know

300
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I know you are hiding something

301
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But I also know there is sincerity in you

302
00:20:32,062 --> 00:20:34,062
So we can't be friends?

303
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,280
How can you trust someone who lied to you?

304
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:43,171
When I'm ready to see you again, I'll let you know.

305
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:54,000
Do you know what the difference is, between us and the rest of the world M’Lady?

306
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:56,000
We can't be completely honest with each other

307
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We have our secrets and sometimes we have to lie

308
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,845
But we know we can trust each other
